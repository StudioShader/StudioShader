		\section{Quantum computing experience}
		
		\cventry{}{}{Quantum Algorithms for VRP and VRPTW Problems}{2021\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
			I did a semester project on the topic “Quantum Algorithms for VRP and VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) Problems” with application to the real case problems of building the routes for drilling machines for oil production in collaboration with GazpromNeft -- one of Russia's major oil companies. I was directly assigned the task of studying current best practices for solving logistics problems on classical computers. The next step was to study current results on solving this problem by quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms. As with many optimization problems, it turned out to be possible to reduce this problem to QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) and solve it using quantum optimization algorithms such as VQE and QAOA. Then I was to develop a simple solver for the multi-traveling salesman problem for small-scale problems (toy problem, up to 7 qubit). It can run locally on a simulator with Qiskit. During this work, I perfectly understood the intricacies of launching and testing quantum algorithms using simulators at IBM Cloud system and how to look for quantum-inspired algorithms and test their applicability.\\

		\cventry{}{}{Study of the Effect of Noise on Efficient Quantum Search Algorithms}{2022\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
			Semester project on the topic "Study of the Effect of Noise on Efficient Quantum Search Algorithms" under the supervision of Sergei Borisovich. In this project I was to implement improved quantum search algorithms for unstructured DB. They are based on the Grover's algorithm and are described in \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03165-2}{this article}. The results of testing algorithms for a problem of no more than five qubits are shown. My task was to dig further into the limits of quantum search algorithms. First, I implemented improved search algorithms. Secondly, I created an environment for testing algorithms with different noise models and different numbers of qubits. Finally, I conducted a set of experiments and explored the impact of noise on variations of the algorithm. In my experiments I used thermal relaxation noise model and coupling map from a real device: "Melbourne". As a result I understood how to run such experiments in order to obtain estimates of the noise parameters for feasible operation of the algorithm. You can find details in \href{https://github.com/StudioShader/QPSA/blob/main/presentation.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{this presentation}} or in \href{https://github.com/StudioShader/QPSA}{\textcolor{blue}{this repository}}.
