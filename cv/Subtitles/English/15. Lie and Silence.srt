00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,700
NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,700
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,800
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,300
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,000
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,400
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,800
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,900
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,100
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,600
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,300
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Second and third Ashino Lakes...
I hope there's no more.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,800
Chairman Keel complained to me directly about the delay of the project yesterday.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,400
He was very frustrated.
He even mentioned dismissing you.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Adam's progressing smoothly. The Eva project has progressed to the dummy plug.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Why are those old
men of Seele so upset ?

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,900
And more importantly, the Human Complement Project's behind schedule.

22
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,900
All projects are mutually linked.
It'll be alright.

23
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,200
About Rei, also ?

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,900
Forget it.

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
By the way, what're you
going to do with ``him ?''

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
I'll leave him alone
just like Marduk Agency.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
He's still useful for
a while longer, isn't he ?

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Kyoto

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,700
What was begun here
sixteen years ago ?

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Episode 15

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
A Lie and Silence
``uso to chinmoku''

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,600
It's me.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,500
Oh, it's you.

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,800
Shanon Bio...
it's a foreign chemical company.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,100
It was established here 9 years ago,
and it hasn't changed in 9 years.

36
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,700
106 out of 108 companies connected to the Marduk Agency are dummies.

37
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,500
And that's the 107th,
isn't it ?

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
This is the registration
of the company.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
You're gonna say, ``Look at the names of the executive officers,'' right ?

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
So, you knew.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I already know
those names.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,900
The Marduk Agency, which was established to choose the pilots for Evangelion...

43
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,000
...is an advisory organization under the Human Complement Committee's direct control.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,300
Details of the organization
are still unknown.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,600
Your duty is to investigate NERV. It's not advisable to meddle with the Organization.

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Well, I won't be satisfied unless
I confirm everything myself.

47
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Hello, this is Kaji. I'm out now.
Please leave a message if you need to.

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Help me, Kaji !
What're you doing, you pervert ?!

49
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
That should do it.

50
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
What happened ?

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Tomorrow's Sunday, and I wanted Kaji to take me somewhere, so I called him...

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
...but he's not there.

53
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,300
He's been out every time
I've called him these days.

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,500
That means you're
free tomorrow, right ?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Unfortunately, yes.

56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
I want to ask
you a little favor.

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,900
Actually...

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Date...?!

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,000
He's my sister Kodama's friend.
I was asked to introduce you.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,100
I beg you.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Yo !

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Do it seriously !

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,700
Sorry.

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,400
Cleaning is what you
should do seriously !

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Necrosis procedure is over.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
The reversible graph,
measuring complete.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
What are you going
to wear tomorrow ?

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
For the wedding reception...?

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,000
I wore a pink suit
at Kiyomi's reception.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
I just wore the deep
blue dress at Kotoko's.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
What about the orange one ?
You haven't worn it for a while.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, that one...?
I can't wear it for some reason...

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,100
Too tight ?

74
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
Damn right.

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I'd better
buy a new one.

76
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
I've had to
spend a lot recently.

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,200
Lately, it's been happening one after another. The cost of gifts isn't going down either.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,100
They must've rushed it
since they're almost thirty.

79
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,000
Neither you nor I want to be the last ones, do we ?

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
All three of you
can come back now.

81
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Good work.

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm tired of tests.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,200
Come to think of it, Shinji looked depressed more than usual today.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Because ``it'' is tomorrow.

85
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
That's right,
``it'' is tomorrow.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,400
I have to see
my father tomorrow.

87
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,600
What do you think
I should talk about ?

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Why are you asking me ?

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Because I've seen you
talking cheerfully to my father.

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,500
Can you tell me...what kind
of person is my father ?

91
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,600
I don't know.

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
I see.

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Is that why you've been
staring at me, to ask that ?

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,700
At cleaning time you were wringing the dust cloth, weren't you ?

95
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,300
You looked motherly.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Mother ?

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
It looked like it was a
mother's way of wringing.

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,300
Actually, you may be suited
to being a housewife.

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
What are you
talking about ?

100
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm home !

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,600
Welcome back.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Get to bed. You have a date tomorrow, don't you ?

103
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah, with a
``handsome'' guy.

104
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,900
Oh, that's right.
Can I use your lavender perfume ?

105
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,200
No.

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
You're stingy.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,300
It's not for children.
Is Shinji in his room ?

108
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,800
He hasn't come out at all. He doesn't seem to want to see his father.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,400
If he doesn't want to, why doesn't he say so ? Japanese are always...

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,500
It doesn't mean that he doesn't want to. And that's the problem.

111
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Go home.

112
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Good job, Shinji.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Shinji...

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
...I'm coming in.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,100
Are you afraid of
seeing your father alone ?

116
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,600
You shouldn't
keep running away...

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,300
...but you have to step forward
or nothing'll change.

118
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,800
I know.

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,600
You'll discover the importance of going forward once you've taken the first step.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Anyway, be confident tomorrow.
You're going to see your mother as well.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Well, good night.

122
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,900
You bought a dress for tomorrow, right ?
Let me see it ?

123
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,100
You wanna see it ?
It was expensive.

124
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Your sense is more
important than the price.

125
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
It's great.

126
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,100
Did you pick one
that Kaji would like ?

127
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,800
Well, I don't now.

128
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,600
The next day.

129
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,500
Well...

130
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,900
...we're...

131
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
...going.

132
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,600
Three bags in your heart...

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,300
Red, blue and yellow...

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Well then, please take
some time to talk freely.

135
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,900
Ryo-chan hasn't showed up.

136
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,900
That idiot never
shows up on time.

137
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,200
For dating, right ?
He does when he's working.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, you two are as
beautiful as ever.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
I couldn't finish
my job in time.

140
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Despite that, you're
always killing time ?

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Besides, why're
you always unshaven ?

142
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,700
Hey, your tie's loose.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
Oh, thanks.

144
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
You guys look like
a married couple.

145
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm pleased to
hear that, Rit-chan.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
Why would we be...?

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,000
It's been three years
since we visited here.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,300
I ran away back then,
and I haven't come back until now.

149
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,100
I don't feel like
my mother's in there.

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,500
I don't remember
her face either.

151
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,600
People live by
forgetting the past.

152
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
But there are things
you shouldn't forget.

153
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Yui taught me
that important fact.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,900
I come here
to reaffirm that.

155
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't you have any photos ?

156
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,500
No. This tombstone's ornamental.
There was no body.

157
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,300
You threw everything away, just like my teacher said, didn't you ?

158
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Everything's inside my heart.
That's enough for now.

159
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,700
It's time.
I'm going back.

160
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Father...

161
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,800
...well, I'm glad that
I could talk to you today.

162
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I see.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,700
NEON GENESIS

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,900
Not bad at all. I didn't know you could do stuff like that.

165
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,300
I can only play this well because I started when I was five...

166
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
...I don't have
much talent.

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,300
Don't they say, ``persistence is a virtue ?''
I have a better impression of you now.

168
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
I started playing because
my teacher suggested it.

169
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
I could have
given it up.

170
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,100
Then, why'd you
keep playing ?

171
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
Because no one
told me to stop.

172
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,300
I thought so.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,600
You're home early. I thought
you were going to eat supper.

174
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,300
He was boring, so I left him while we were waiting for the roller coaster.

175
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,100
That's pretty rude.

176
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Kaji's the only nice guy.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,000
What're you talking about ?
I'm going to the bathroom.

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,200
Don't disappear.

179
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,300
High-heels...?

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
When was the last
time we drank together ?

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,900
Misato's been drinking too much.
She seems happy for some reason.

182
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Drink to hide your cheerful self...
Today, I might be like that.

183
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The person who lived with her
says something convincing.

184
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,400
We lived together, but that's before she put on high-heels.

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,100
We couldn't imagine that
when we were in school.

186
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,700
I was young, and we were simply staying in the same place. It was like playing house.

187
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
The reality isn't so sweet.

188
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, this is
for your cat.

189
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,100
Thanks.
You're so nice.

190
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,900
Only to women.
My work's sloppy.

191
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,000
I wonder.
To Misato, also ?

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,900
I bought a farm once. I won't join a losing war. That's my policy.

193
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,700
I think you have
a winning strategy.

194
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
What about you, Rit-chan ?

195
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,700
I have a policy not to talk about myself,
because it's not very interesting.

196
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,000
She's late. I wonder if
she's touching up her makeup.

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Why did you
go to Kyoto ?

198
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Hey, that's
from Matsushiro.

199
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't play innocent. If you go too far, your fingers will get burned.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm giving you a warning,
as a friend.

201
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,500
I'll listen. It's okay if I get burned while I'm playing with you...

202
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,800
Should I buy you
some fireworks ?

203
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,700
Oh, welcome back.

204
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
Your fickle personality
hasn't changed at all.

205
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes, it has.
To live is to change.

206
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,900
That's homeostasis
and transistasis.

207
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
What's that ?

208
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,000
The forces to maintain or
change the current situation.

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,300
We have both of those conflicting characteristics at the same time.

210
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,400
Like a man and woman.

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,500
I'd better go home.
I still have work to do.

212
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Really ?

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Too bad.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,100
Bye.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,900
Shin-chan...?
It's me.

216
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm drinking with Kaji.
Yes, we're holding a third party.

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Okay...okay...bye.

218
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,200
Misato ?

219
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,300
Yeah. She said she'll be late
and to go to bed.

220
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,500
She's not coming home
tomorrow morning, is she ?

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
She can't be because
Kaji's with her.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,200
Are you stupid ?!
That's why I asked.

223
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Grownups usually don't puke.

224
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,400
Sorry about being
old already.

225
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
We're the same age.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
That's right.

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,000
You're wearing high-heels.
I really feel like time has passed.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Why don't you shave ?

229
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,700
Okay, okay.

230
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll walk.  Thanks.

231
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,800
Kaji, have I changed ?

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
You've become more beautiful.

233
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry that I said
goodbye back then.

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,500
I told you I fell in love with another guy, but it was a lie. Did you know that ?

235
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
No.

236
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I noticed that
you were like my father.

237
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,300
I was longing for
my father in men.

238
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,300
When I noticed that,
I was scared, so scared.

239
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,300
Staying with you, being a woman.
Everything was scary.

240
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,400
I hated my father, but I fell in love with a man like him.

241
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,000
I joined NERV
to forget everything.

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,900
But it's the organization my father once belonged to.

243
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,800
I was deceiving myself by
taking revenge against Angels.

244
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,800
You've chosen to do that.
You don't have to apologize to me.

245
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,600
No, I didn't choose !
I was simply running away.

246
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
I ran away from the
chains called ``father.''

247
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
It's just like Shinji.

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,700
I'm a coward.

249
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm really sorry to say such things,
though it's because I'm drunk.

250
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,500
That's enough.

251
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm so childish. I have no
right to preach to Shinji.

252
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,500
That's enough.

253
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm hypocritical because I rely on a man at my convenience, just like now !

254
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,800
I might have used you back then !
I hate it !

255
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,100
That's enough. Stop.

256
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm so disappointed
in myself !

257
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,700
Hey Shinji,
do you want to kiss ?

258
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
What ?

259
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Kiss, you know, a kiss.
You haven't kissed, right ?

260
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,300
Then, let's do it.

261
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Why ?

262
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,100
Because it's boring.

263
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,000
``Boring,'' you said...?

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,400
You don't want to kiss on the anniversary of your mom's death, do you ?

265
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Do you think she might
be watching us from Heaven ?

266
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,100
No.

267
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,100
Are you scared ?

268
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,400
No, I'm not
scared of kissing.

269
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,800
You brushed your teeth,
didn't you ?

270
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
Then, here I come.

271
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,500
Don't breathe through
your nose, it tickles.

272
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,000
Yuck ! I shouldn't have done it
to kill time after all !

273
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,300
Hey, we're home.
Hang on.

274
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,300
Kaji.

275
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Kaji !

276
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Well, I'm going home.

277
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Why don't you stay ?

278
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,100
They'll laugh at me if
I go to work looking like this.

279
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
It's okay.

280
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,700
Right, Kaji ?

281
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
See ya.

282
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
The smell of lavender...

283
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,300
You two, take care
of Katsuragi, okay ?

284
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Good night.

286
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
Good night.

287
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,700
What's wrong ?
You look disappointed.

288
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,500
It's because I kissed you !

289
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, girls are next.

290
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,300
Next day.

291
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
Ayanami...

292
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,000
Is Ayanami absent today, too ?

293
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,900
NERV Headquarters

294
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,300
The center of the deep
underground facilities.

295
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Central Dogma

296
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,500
Same location.
2008 meters under ground.

297
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,300
Terminal Dogma

298
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
How's your hangover ?

299
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
It's gone, thanks to you.

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
That's good.

301
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Is this your true job ?
Or just part time ?

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,100
I don't know.

303
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Kaji Ryouji belongs to the Special Inspection Division of the Special Institute, NERV...

304
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,800
...but you also belong to Japan's Ministry of the Interior, don't you ?

305
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
You knew, huh ?

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Don't underestimate NERV.

307
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,900
Did Commander Ikari order you ?

308
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,500
No, this's my own act.

309
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
If you continue your part time job any further, you'll die.

310
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,400
Commander Ikari's making use of me.
I'll continue for a while.

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,500
But I apologize to you
for keeping this a secret.

312
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,100
I'll cancel this to show
my thanks for last night.

313
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,500
Thanks. But the Commander, and even Rit-chan, kept this a secret from you.

314
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
This is it.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,900
That's...

316
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,400
Eva...

317
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
No...it can't be.

318
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,300
Yes, it's the key to
everything since the Second Impact...

319
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,400
...and it was the
beginning as well.

320
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
It's Adam.

321
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,000
Adam...?
The First Angel is here...?!

322
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Surely, NERV can't
be taken lightly.
