Mama!  Mama!  They selected me!

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,570
I'm an elite pilot, about to protect
mankind.  The best in the world.

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,520
It's a secret to everybody.
But I'll tell you, Mama!

16
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,650
Everybody is so nice to me,
that I'm not lonely.

17
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,220
I'm OK, even though I don't have a papa.

18
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,290
So, look!  Look at me!

19
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,300
Hey Mama!

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,470
Start making sense, you idiot!

21
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,380
How many times do I have to say it?!

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,580
Kaji-san's not here anymore!

23
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:15,720
Oh...

24
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,830
Synchro ratio zero.

25
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,880
I've no capacity to be the Second Children.

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,380
I've no reason to exist.

27
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,120
No one looks at me.

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,250
Not Papa, Mama, or anybody.

29
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,270
There's no reason for me to live.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,050
You are Soryu Asuka Langley?

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,170
The second section of the Intelligence Division
says the Second Children was captured alive.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,470
I see.  They found her 7 days after
they lost her.  That isn't like them.

33
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,320
Maybe it was on purpose, then.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,870
The Planning Division is
trying to make trouble for us.

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,210
I see.

36
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,300
<i>And today the Fifth will arrive to replace Asuka.</i>

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,500
<i>The scenario is too prearranged.</i>

38
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,560
Ayanami Rei.

39
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,970
It may be correct...  that impression.

40
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,360
My mother...

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,280
Ayanami Rei...  and my mother...

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,530
What are you doing with them...  Father?!

43
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,710
Commander Ikari...

44
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,130
My cat died...

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,480
...which my grandmother
had been taking care of.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,890
I hadn't been taking care of it for a long time.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,170
Suddenly, I can't see it again.

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,700
Why did you destroy the Dummy System?

49
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,500
It's not the Dummy System,
but Rei who I destroyed.

50
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,290
I ask you once more.  Why?

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,270
Now, I'm not happy even if you hold me.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,420
You can do anything you like
to my body, as you did before.

53
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,260
I was disappointed by you.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,260
Disappointed?!  You have neither
expectations nor hopes for me.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,830
I have nothing...  nothing...  nothing...

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,090
What should I do, mother?

57
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,050
Where has Asuka been?

58
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,520
<i>What should I talk to her about?
Tell her about Ayanami?</i>

59
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,030
<i>Toji and Kensuke lost their houses
here and went away somewhere.</i>

60
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,420
<i>No friends...  I have no friends here.</i>

61
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,880
<i>No one.</i>

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>I don't want to see Ayanami.
I lost the courage to see her.</i>

63
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,200
<i>How should I act with her?</i>

64
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,380
<i>Asuka...</i>

65
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,040
<i>Misato-san...</i>

66
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,080
<i>Mother...</i>

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,610
<i>What should I do?  What?!</i>

68
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,590
A song is good.

69
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,500
A song brings us joy.

70
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,050
A song is the highest culture
that Lilims have created.

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,380
Don't you think so?

72
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,050
Ikari Shinji-kun.

73
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,750
You know my name?

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,160
Everyone knows your name.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,780
Excuse me, but you'd better be
aware of your own position.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,150
Is that so?

77
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,170
Umm, who are you?

78
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm Kaoru.  Nagisa Kaoru.
of the Seashore)

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,550
Just like you, I'm one of the selected
children.  I'm the Fifth Children.

80
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Fifth Children?!

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,670
You...  Nagisa-kun?

82
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,040
Call me 'Kaoru', Ikari-kun.

83
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,020
Alright, call me 'Shinji'.

84
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,410
Reportedly, the Fifth Children has just arrived.

85
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,590
Nagisa Kaoru.  The record of his life
has already been deleted, like Rei.

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,170
One thing we know is that his birthday
is the same day as Second Impact.

87
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,750
The committee sent him
directly to us.  He has something.

88
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,640
The information on the Fifth in the Marduk
Report is not permitted for publication.

89
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,510
For this reason, I secretly investigated
the data in the Intelligence Division.

90
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,670
Oh, you risked too much.

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,460
The risk was worth it.

92
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,930
I know where Ritsuko-san is.

93
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,240
How are you going to do
the synchro test for the Fifth?

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,330
I don't have any plans to cheat
today.  Let's see his ability.

95
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,470
Down 0.3 more.

96
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:56,950
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,650
Are there any mistakes in this reading?

98
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,710
The testing system is operating normally.

99
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,460
No data error detected by the Magi.

100
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,940
It's amazing that this boy synchronizes
with Unit 02 before replacing the core.

101
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,770
Yet, I can't believe it.

102
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,420
I mean, it's impossible on this system.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,170
Nevertheless, it's a fact.

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,870
We must accept the fact and
then investigate the cause.

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,670
So you're the First Children?

106
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,600
Ayanami Rei.

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,650
You're the same as me.

108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,930
We've both taken the Lilim's form
as our body to live on this planet.

109
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,620
Who are you?

110
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,870
I hear that the Fifth boy contacted Rei.

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,830
Is that so?

112
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,680
The Magi are doing their best
to scan the data on the Fifth.

113
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,690
Still, we don't know yet what he really is.

114
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,950
What is he, that boy?

115
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,530
Authorized Personnel ONLY
If you enter without my
permission, you shall die!
Entry Forbidden!

116
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,940
Shinji-kun hasn't returned.

117
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,780
I'm disqualified as his guardian.

118
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,650
Central Dogma is now being opened.
Use the 3rd route for the transfer.

119
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,790
Hey, you were waiting for me?

120
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh, no I did...  I didn't mean to.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,350
Today is?

122
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,710
Well, the usual test was over and I was
going to take a shower before I went home.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,250
But, I don't want to go home these days.

124
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,820
You have a house, or a home to go to.
That fact makes you happy.  That's nice.

125
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,100
Is that so?

126
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,400
I want to talk with you some more.

127
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,050
May I go with you?

128
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,330
I mean to the shower.
Aren't you going to shower?

129
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,740
Yeah...

130
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,230
You mean 'no'?

131
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,030
Oh, yes.  I don't mean 'no'.

132
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,010
You avoid contact of the first kind at all costs.

133
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,670
Do you fear to feel other people?

134
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:16,450
Being ignorant of others, you will never
be betrayed or hurt, though you will
never escape from feeling sadness.

135
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,900
A person can't erase sadness
forever.  Everyone is alone.

136
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,010
However, people can forget,
and so they are able to live.

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,590
It's time.

138
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,520
It's over?

139
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,790
Yeah, we have to go to bed.

140
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,890
Together?

141
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,610
No, you are provided with
your own, different room.

142
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,370
Well...

143
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,770
People always feel pain in their hearts.

144
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,600
The heart is easy to wound,
that's why living is painful.

145
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,430
In particular, your heart is fragile like glass.

146
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,430
Me?

147
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,750
Yes, worthy of love.

148
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,100
Love?

149
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,880
I mean, I love you.

150
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,250
Episode 24'

151
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,020
The Final Messenger

152
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,020
[  note:  this can
also be read as
' The Final Death '
or even  (phoenet-
ically)  ' The Final
Seashore '  ]

153
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,490
Nerv, the system established to act under Seele.

154
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,560
Founded to play our scenario.

155
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,040
Now, it has been exclusively
taken by one person.

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,380
Aye, we must take it back.

157
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,930
Before the promised day.

158
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Let Nerv and the Eva
series be as they should be.

159
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,770
Ikari, you are responsible for betraying Seele.

160
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,970
The time remaining to us is short.

161
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,610
And, now we don't have the Lance of Longinus
that would prevent us from realizing our hopes.

162
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,770
The final Angel will soon appear.  When
we erase that, our hopes will come true.

163
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,120
Wait a little longer, Yui.

164
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,950
Why am I here?

165
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,620
Why am I still alive?

166
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,650
For what?

167
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,020
For whom?

168
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,370
The Fifth Children.

169
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,460
He looks...

170
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,440
...something like me.

171
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,670
Why?

172
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,820
We are lucky because we
live in the suburb of the city.

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,450
You weren't involved, I'm glad about that.

174
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,560
Yet, next time I can't guarantee that.

175
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,400
So, you'll be taken care of at
Horaki-san's from tomorrow on.

176
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,980
So long, Pen Pen.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,740
Really, I should be on the floor.

178
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,370
No, it's me who asked you to let me stay here.

179
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,580
It's OK if I sleep here.

180
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,630
What do you want to say?

181
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,230
You have something that you want me to hear.

182
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,660
I've experienced many
things, since I came here.

183
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,890
I was at my sensei's before.

184
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,560
Those were silent and calm days.

185
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,800
I did nothing but exist.

186
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,510
But that was fine with me.

187
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,480
I had nothing to do.

188
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,720
Do you dislike people?

189
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,860
Well, I don't really care.

190
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,300
Except for my father, who I hate.

191
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,460
<i>Why am I talking about this
kind of thing with Kaoru-kun?</i>

192
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,110
I might have been born to meet you.

193
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,030
Humans are unable to create
something out of nothing.

194
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,820
They must have something to start
with, because humans aren't gods.

195
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,550
But there's a man who seeks
to gain power equal to God's.

196
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,790
There's a man besides us who
wants to reopen Pandora's Box.

197
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,330
And who wants to close the
Box, before Hope can appear.

198
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,880
Hope?  That's the Lilim's hope?

199
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,250
There are as many forms of
hope as there are people.

200
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,290
Because hope exists only
in the hearts of people.

201
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,870
But our hopes are materializing...

202
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,210
In Lilith, progenitor of humanity - the
false successors from the Black Moon...

203
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,040
And in Adam, progenitor of Angels - the
true successors from the lost White Moon.

204
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,120
And whose salvaged soul
resides only within you...

205
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,660
But whose revived body is already inside Ikari.

206
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,750
Shinji-kun's father...  Is he like me?

207
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,070
That's why we now entrust our hope to you.

208
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,680
I know...  for that's the reason I'm here now.

209
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,880
It's no good, I can't read his lips from here.

210
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,690
Still, going for a walk at this early
hour just to talk to yourself...  time
for some serious psychiatric work.

211
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,830
Did he notice me?

212
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,390
No, impossible.

213
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,530
Everything is going according
to the Lilim's plans.

214
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,480
Well?  Do you have his data?

215
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,130
Here you go.  I borrowed this from First
Lieutenant Ibuki without her permission.

216
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,750
I'm sorry that I made you
do something like a thief.

217
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,440
What's this?

218
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,920
It's quite natural that Maya-chan can't
publish this.  It's theoretically impossible.

219
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,790
Hmm, yes.  The mystery increases.

220
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,470
He can arrange any Eva synchro
ratio freely, by his own will.

221
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,060
We must do anything we can, without
considering what others think.

222
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,860
You dared to come here?

223
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,640
I have one thing to ask you.

224
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,250
This conversation is being recorded.

225
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,260
I don't care.

226
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,690
What is that boy, the Fifth?

227
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,530
Probably...  the final messenger.

228
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,250
Well, let's go.

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,450
Come, Adam's alter ego,
and the servant of the Lilim.

230
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
Eva Unit 02 started!

231
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,740
What the hell?!  Where's Asuka?

232
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,290
In hospital room 303.  It's confirmed.

233
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,820
Then who is...?

234
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,270
It's unmanned.  Entry plug hasn't been inserted.

235
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,440
Unmanned?  Isn't it the Fifth?

236
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,440
AT Field generation detected in Central Dogma.

237
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,360
Unit 02?

238
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,230
No, pattern is blue.
No doubt.  It's an Angel!

239
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,230
What?

240
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,830
An Angel?  That boy?

241
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,870
Target passing by the fourth level.  Still descending.

242
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,960
No good.  Can't disconnect the power
supply to the Linear Motor Car.

243
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,720
Target passing by the fifth level.

244
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,700
Close all bulkheads in Central Dogma!

245
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,900
Anything to gain time.

246
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,970
Close all levels up to the Fifth Malebolge.

247
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,260
All personnel, evacuate.  All personnel, evacuate.

248
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,250
Seele dared to send it directly to us.

249
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,370
The old men are trying to
advance the schedule, using us.

250
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,550
People forget their foolishness
and repeat the same mistakes.

251
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,310
People won't change if they
perform their own atonement.

252
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,980
We won't rely on Adam or the Angels.

253
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,290
We must advance into the
future by our own means.

254
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,060
Eva Unit 01, fulfill your duty.

255
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,080
Armored bulkheads broken
through by Eva Unit 02.

256
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,320
Target passing the second level.

257
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,410
Eva Unit 01 will pursue.

258
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,130
Yes, sir.

259
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,940
Use any means.  Don't allow the
target to invade Terminal Dogma.

260
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,540
But why is the Angel using Unit 02?

261
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,580
Is he trying to unite with Unit 02?

262
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Or to lead it to destruction?

263
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,300
No No No!  Kaoru-kun is...  an Angel?!

264
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,000
It must be a lie!!

265
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,110
It's true.  Accept the facts.

266
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,280
Sortie, OK?

267
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,750
Shinji-kun hasn't come yet.

268
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,390
Eva Unit 01, descending through route 2.

269
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,820
Pursuing the target.

270
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,340
You betrayed me!

271
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,260
You betrayed my heart!

272
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,520
You betrayed me like my father!

273
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,640
Unit 01 has reached the fourth layer.

274
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,800
Contacting the target.

275
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,040
You're here.

276
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,480
I've been waiting for you, Shinji-kun.

277
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,490
Kaoru-kun!

278
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
Asuka, sorry!

279
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,480
Eva series, created from Adam,
the beings detested by humans.

280
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,370
Still the Lilims are trying
to survive by using them.

281
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,280
I can't understand why.

282
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,120
Kaoru-kun, stop!  I don't see why!

283
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,600
Eva is made of the same body as me.

284
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,700
Because I'm also born of Adam.

285
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,100
When the unit doesn't have
a soul, I can unite with it.

286
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,090
The soul of Unit 02 is shutting itself up now.

287
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,680
AT Field!

288
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Yes, you Lilims call it that.

289
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,730
The holy region that must
not be invaded by anyone.

290
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,500
The light of the soul.

291
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,260
You Lilims are aware of that.

292
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,370
Aware that the AT Field is the
wall of the soul that everyone has.

293
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,630
I don't understand that, Kaoru-kun!

294
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,210
Both Eva units have reached the final level.

295
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,540
20 meters until the target
reaches Terminal Dogma.

296
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,650
If something happens to Unit 01,
after the signal disappears...

297
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,020
I know.  You're going to
self destruct this place.

298
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,740
It's better than letting Third Impact take place.

299
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,310
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,090
Not at all, if I can die with you.

301
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,290
Thanks.

302
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,610
The destination of people?

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,840
The hope of people is the thread of sadness.

304
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,250
What's that?!

305
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,670
The strongest AT Field we've ever seen!

306
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,490
Light waves, electromagnetic
waves and particles are shut out.

307
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,030
We can't monitor anything!

308
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,300
That's a field?

309
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,630
The target, Eva Units 02 and 01, all missing.

310
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,450
Can't connect to the pilot.

311
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,470
Kaoru-kun!

312
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,000
Wait!

313
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,570
Final safety system released.

314
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,760
Heaven's Door is opening.

315
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,230
The Angel has arrived?

316
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,200
Hyuga-kun...

317
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,270
What?!

318
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,140
Status?

319
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,150
It's an AT Field.

320
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,630
Another AT Field, similar to the previous one,
has been generated around Terminal Dogma.

321
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,210
Invading the other field.

322
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,280
Impossible.  Does that mean another Angel?

323
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,670
I don't know!  I can't confirm it!

324
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,360
I mean, it vanished.

325
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,440
Vanished?  An Angel?

326
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,420
Adam, our mother being.

327
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,990
Those born from Adam must return to Adam,
even if it means annihilating humanity?

328
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,430
No!  It's different.

329
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,010
Lilith!

330
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,710
I see.  I understand, Lilim.

331
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,110
Thank you, Shinji-kun.

332
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,940
I wished you'd beat Unit 02.

333
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,850
Otherwise, I might have lived with her.

334
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,940
Kaoru-kun, why?

335
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,420
I've been destined to live forever, even
if humanity is annihilated as a result.

336
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,610
However, I'm able to die.

337
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,510
To be or not to be.

338
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,410
It makes no difference to me.

339
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,160
My death is the only absolute liberty.

340
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,390
What are you talking about?

341
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,360
Kaoru-kun, I don't understand
what you're talking about!

342
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,320
Kaoru-kun...

343
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,920
My last words.

344
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,930
Now, please erase me.

345
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,480
Otherwise, you'll be erased.

346
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,780
The life that escapes the time of annihilation,
and that obtains the future, is only one.

347
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,210
And you aren't the one who must die.

348
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,420
All of you need the future.

349
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,930
Thank you.  I'm glad...  to have met you.

350
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,910
Kaoru-kun...

351
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,950
...said, 'I love you'.

352
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,370
To me!

353
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,910
For the first time...  For the
first time I heard those words.

354
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,310
He looked like me.

355
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,140
And Ayanami.

356
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,750
I loved him.

357
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,860
Kaoru-kun should have
been the one to survive.

358
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,990
He was much better than I am.

359
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,260
He should have survived.

360
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,700
No.

361
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,140
A survivor only needs the will to survive.

362
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,990
He wished to die.

363
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,740
He abandoned the will to live,
and depended on false hope.

364
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,160
You weren't wrong, Shinji-kun.

365
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,970
You're cold, Misato-san.
