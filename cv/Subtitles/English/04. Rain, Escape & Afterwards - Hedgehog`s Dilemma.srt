16
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,600
I wonder if he's going to play hooky again today.

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,000
Shin-chan's room.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,400
Shinji, get up ! Why do
you keep skipping school ?!

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,900
It's been five days.
Unit 01 is completely repaired.

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,100
You're the pilot, how can
you leave it that way ?

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Shinji ?

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,700
He's run away......
That's not surprising.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,200
EPISODE 4:
Rain,
After He
Ran Away.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,200
Shinji...?!

25
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,200
Um, we're...

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're Ikari Shinji's classmates,
Aida and Suzuhara.

27
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,400
Aida and Suzuhara ?

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,300
Yes.

29
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm Suzuhara.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,900
If I'm not mistaken, you're the ones who got into Unit 01's entry plug ?

31
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,400
We're very sorry for causing you so much trouble the other day.

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Ikari has been absent from school since then, so we just came to see if he's okay.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Shinji. He's at Nerv's
training center right now.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh, I see.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Here are the prints which
were piled on his desk.

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
Sorry for all the trouble.
Thank you.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Well, please excuse us.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Please say hello
to Shinji for us.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,900
Yes, I will. Bye.

40
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,600
This's an
unexpected development.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
She's beautiful,
isn't she ?

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,200
Shinji, you damned fool !

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
Idiot !

44
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Exit on the right side
at the next station.

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,100
Thank you very much for taking Tokyo-3's Loop Line 7 today.

46
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,700
This train will be out
of service at this station.

47
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Everyone, please check to be sure you don't forget any of your belongings when you exit.

48
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,600
I have to go back.

49
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,400
Didn't you detect it ?

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,200
No. An object with a diameter
of tens of millimeters...

51
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,600
...hit Antarctica at
ten percent of light speed.

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,100
With our scientific knowledge, we could neither detect nor prevent it.

53
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,700
It's hell on earth outside.
What does science exist for ?!

54
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,700
At present, the atmosphere flow caused by the Earth's axis transition has decreased 3%.

55
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,800
Has it calmed
down at all ?

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
No. A tidal wave's approaching at a speed of 230 meters/second.

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Doctor, let's escape.

58
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,700
I have an obligation
to stay here.

59
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,200
Doctor, it's easy to die, but you have an obligation to watch this hellish world...

60
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,000
Idiot.

61
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,500
He's only
14 years old.

62
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,600
In the end, it seems so cruel for him to be burdened with humanity's destiny.

63
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,500
But we must entrust the piloting of the Evas to the hands of 14 year old children.

64
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,600
I know.

65
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
So, have you
heard from him ?

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,100
Nothing ?

67
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,300
Nothing.
He might not come back.

68
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
What are you
going to do ?

69
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,500
Nothing special.

70
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
If he doesn't come back,
it might be better for him.

71
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Why ?

72
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,800
After the last battle...

73
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
Why did you
ignore my orders ?

74
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,400
I'm your commander
in the operation, right ?

76
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,300
Yes.

77
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,400
You have an obligation to obey my orders. Do you understand ?

78
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Yes.

79
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
Make this the last time.

80
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Yes.

81
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,600
Do you really understand
what I'm saying ?

82
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes.

83
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey, it won't be all right if you answer only ``yes'' to everything vaguely.

84
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,200
I understand well, of course. That's enough, isn't it ? We won anyway.

85
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,900
As long as you go along with what others want ostensibly, you may feel comfortable.

86
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,600
But if you continue to get into Eva with such a feeling, you'll be killed.

87
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
I wouldn't mind.

88
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,300
I wish I could
say you're resolute...

89
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,600
...but you're making a big mistake if you think you'll be praised by me, Ikari Shinji.

90
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,600
That isn't the question. Anyhow, I'm the only one who can pilot it.

91
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
I'll do it.

92
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,700
I see.

93
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,400
If it's only pain for him to pilot Eva,
then he shouldn't do it.

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm sure he'll be killed.

95
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,300
But we need pilots.

96
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400
Captain !

97
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
A...Aida, go ahead !

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,100
I can't go without you.

99
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,500
You fool !

100
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
Transferee !

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Ikari !

102
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
NEON GENESIS

103
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Touji's sorry about that.

104
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
He said that he'd been
scolded by his younger sister.

105
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,500
She told him that it was the robot that saved our lives.

106
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
It's shameful that he was scolded by a primary schooler, wasn't it ?

107
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,300
I like night because the
cicadas don't make loud noises.

108
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,900
Although, their number
has been growing in recent years.

109
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,700
Misato said that the ecosystems are returning to their former states.

110
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:43,400
Misato...I envy you. You live with such a beautiful lady and can pilot Evangelion.

111
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,000
If I could pilot it just once,
my heart would be content.

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,100
You'd better not. I think your mother would be worried.

113
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Ah, it's O.K.
I don't have one.

114
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm the same as you.

115
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
You'll eat, won't you ?

116
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah.

117
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Do you do this
kind of thing often ?

118
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Well, sort of...

119
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Is it training for
guerrilla warfare ?

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,400
What could I do with toys like these ?~~I just like to.

121
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,500
You're Ikari Shinji,
aren't you ?

122
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Yes.

123
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
We're from
Nerv Security Intelligence.

124
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
According to the eighth clause of
Public Security Regulations...

125
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,900
...we're taking you
to headquarters. Alright ?

126
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Okay.

127
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Then, you just watched ?!

128
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,700
That's easy for you to say, but like I said, they were pros from Nerv Security Intelligence.

129
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,500
So what ?! I can't believe
you don't have any balls !

130
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Disgusting.

131
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,800
Pervert.

132
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,500
Haru !

133
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,200
The one who fights without any chance of winning is a fool.

134
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,700
It's got nothing
to do with balls.

135
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,500
It's been a while.

136
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,300
Yes.

137
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,100
Bumming around for two days...
Did it cheer you up ?

138
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Not really.

139
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Eva is ready.
Are you going to pilot it...?

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
...or aren't you ?

141
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You won't scold me, will you ?

142
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,600
That's natural, because
you're not my relative.

143
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,200
If I tell you that I don't want to pilot Unit 01, how will you deal with it ?

144
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,400
I think Rei will pilot it.
Won't you pilot it ?

145
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,500
It seems unrealistic that
you'd force it all off on her.

146
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,400
Don't worry,
I'll pilot it.

147
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,900
You don't want to,
do you ?

148
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,600
Of course not. First of all,
I'm not cut out for it.

149
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
But Ayanami,
you and Ritsuko...

150
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
Knock it off already !

151
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,400
It's got nothing to do
with what others say !

152
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,200
If you don't want to
pilot it, then leave !

153
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,700
Forget about Eva and us completely !
Go back to where you came from !

154
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,400
It's wrong for you to
pilot it with such feelings.

155
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,300
The ``Third Child'' is
leaving Tokyo-3 tomorrow.

156
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,100
Then we'll reconfigure the
data of Unit 01 for Rei.

157
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,000
But...

158
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Regardless of the data from
Unit 00's restart experiment...

159
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,400
...we'll resume
with Unit 01.

160
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
According to the
Marduk Organization's report...

161
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,100
...the ``Fourth Child''
hasn't been found yet.

162
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,500
You mean that we don't
have anyone to substitute ?

163
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,900
Wh...where's Misato ?
I'd like to say good-bye.

164
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,900
You don't belong to Nerv now, so I can't tell you anything.

165
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,900
Ikari, you forgot this !

166
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,500
Uh, can I have
a little time ?

167
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,600
Um...thank you.

168
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,600
Touji, say it ! Come on !

169
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Ikari, I'm sorry that I punched you twice. Hit me, please !

170
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,900
I can't do that.

171
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,600
Please. Otherwise,
I won't be satisfied.

172
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, he's an
embarrassing guy like this.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
If it'll settle this,
why not ?

174
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
But...

175
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Be quick ! You don't
have time, right ?

176
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Only once, then.

177
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay !
Come on !

178
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Stop !

179
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Don't hold back !

180
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
How did you know...?

181
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,800
It was a hunch. We've seen dozens of classmates off lately.

182
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,300
If you leave, we'll also have
to leave this city some day.

183
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:24,800
But we don't have the right to say anything about that. We saw you suffering in the Eva.

184
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,500
If I find someone
who blames you...

185
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
...I'll beat the
crap out of him !

186
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,800
Don't make such
a gloomy face.

187
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,100
Cheer up.

188
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,200
Hang in there.

189
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm...

190
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,100
Time's up.

191
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm the one who
needed to be hit !

192
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,700
I'm a coward,
I'm timid...

193
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,600
...dishonest and
a weakling...

194
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't give us
any more trouble.

195
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,100
He's gone.

196
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Do you think
this is best ?

197
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,000
The hedgehog's dilemma...

198
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,500
The closer they get, the more deeply they hurt each other...

199
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
I've figured out
what it means.

200
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,100
He can't let others know his feelings in any other way than that.

201
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,800
A linear express train for Atsugi is arriving on Track 2.

202
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,700
Be careful and stand
behind the yellow line.

203
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,100

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,200
Anyone without authorization is firmly prohibited from boarding.

206
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,400
Hang in there.

207
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Look.

208
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
It's that babe.

209
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,100
A local train for Gora
is arriving on Track 4 soon.

210
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Be careful and stand
behind the yellow line.

211
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,300
If you are accompanied by small children, pay attention to them, please.

212
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,900
The train on Track 4 is the local one which is turning back for Gora.

213
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,400
If you take this train,
please wait inside.

214
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,700
The train is arriving soon.
Please stand behind the yellow line.

215
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I...I'm back.

216
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,300
