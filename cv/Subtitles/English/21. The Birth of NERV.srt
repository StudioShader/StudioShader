1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,540
In the year AD 2000

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,100
The Super Solenoid theory
proposed by Professor Katsuragi?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,860
It's just too far-fetched!

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,200
It's still just a theory...

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,010
Even so, the S2 theory is the only way to
explain the source of that giant's power.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,040
I heard that Ikari's team is leaving
on the 11th of next month.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,390
I wish they'd locate the smoking sections closer.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,750
And it's already been proven,
even if it was by accident.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,450
There was talk about making the entire facility
non-smoking, so just be happy with what you've got.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,850
The fact that it exists means
that it must be accepted.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,890
Scientists...
they believe too much in their own ideas.

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,180
I'd have to leave here if that happened -
I can't work without my cigarettes.

13
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,920
I'll accept it when and only when
all the data has been verified.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,400
It's cold, the food is bad...truly a god-forsaken
place at the end of the world.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,190
What about the Lance of Longinus?

16
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,410
Self-flattery.

17
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,270
It's still where it was brought ashore after
arriving from the Dead Sea last week.

18
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,290
And they argue too much...
Endless criticism and speculation.

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,780
Isn't some processing necessary
before taking the Lance underground?

20
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,400
And people like that are given charge
of the truth...  How ironic.

21
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,020
What?  Not "A" lunch again?!

22
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,220
Will it be okay?

23
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Damn, I could kill for some Osaka sushi!

24
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,690
The physical contact experiment is
scheduled for the 13th of next month.

25
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,670
'God' is not that lofty of an issue...

26
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,190
There's plenty of time for any adjustments.

27
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,290
Discovery is fine and well,
but they'll never understand it.

28
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,790
All they seek is
their own exaltation.

29
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,400
It's surpassing calculated predictions!

30
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,780
Block out surface lights!

31
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Emergency...  Emergency...

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,200
The DNA that dived into
Adam is physically uniting!

33
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
All personnel put on your protective clothing.

34
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Workers below level two please evacuate
to upper area of Central Dogma.

35
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,470
Workers below level two please evacuate
to upper area of Central Dogma.

36
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,280
Fields have gone down.

37
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,460
The Lance!  Pull back the Lance!

38
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,510
The Lance!  Pull back the Lance!
up!

39
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,060
We can't!  The floor isn't holding up!

40
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,100
It's sinking!

41
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,000
We have to prevent further
damage as much as possible!

42
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,000
Break down the atomic structure, but
keep it within the quark range!  Hurry!

43
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
When the Gauf doors open, start the cooling!

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,700
Amazing!  It's starting to walk!

45
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,500
Even if only for a half a second, we have to
put an anti-AT Field around him!  Get enough
energy to generate an anti-AT Field!

46
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
The conversion system is already set!

47
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Countdown has been activated!

48
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
The S2 engine and the explosive system
are being linked!  We can't stop it!

49
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,200
The wings are spreading!  It's going to surface!

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,500
Like a cruel angel...

51
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,500
...young boy, become a legend.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,900
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

53
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:16,000
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Lost while searching for something soft...

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,200
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,600
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,700
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,900
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

59
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,300
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,100
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

61
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,700
Neon Genesis

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640
Hello, I'm away right now.
Please leave your message after the beep.

63
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,180
My last job...

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,360
It's red, just like blood.

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,720
~~ Nerv, the Birth ~~

66
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,930
Kidnapped?  Our vice commander?

67
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,520
It was two hours ago.
He has been missing since he
entered the 8th district in the west.

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,930
That's inside of this installation.

69
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,550
You guys in the Division of Intelligence
did nothing to stop it?

70
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,330
An insider was spying on us
and lead the operation.

71
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,650
We were outwitted by that person.

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,410
Someone who can baffle the Second
Division of Intelligence.  It can't be...

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,870
Kaji Ryoji is suspected to be
the leader of this plot.

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,500
That's why you came to see me.

75
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,560
You can help us a great deal,
because you think quickly.

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,640
As your colleagues, we truly regret
having to suspect the Chief of Operations.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,500
However, this is our job.

78
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,690
Considering our past,
it's the only natural reaction.

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,620
Thank you for your cooperation.

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,670
Take her away.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,790
It's been a long time, Chairman Kihl.
This is a very crude way of welcoming me.

82
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,630
There is no need for the
Commander to be called here.

83
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,150
We need to have a long discussion
with you, and this is the best way.

84
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,470
You never change.  You don't take
my situation into account.

85
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,690
The problem we are addressing now has already
emerged.  The consequences are inevitable.

86
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,430
Please understand that.

87
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,100
Not the committee, but Seele
itself has finally appeared.

88
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,290
We have no intention of
creating a new god.

89
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,400
We hope for your cooperation,
Fuyutsuki-sensei.

90
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,870
<i>Fuyutsuki-sensei...</i>

91
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,870
Sensei!  Fuyutsuki-sensei!

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,930
AD 1999
Kyoto

93
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,480
Oh, it's you guys.

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,270
How about having a beer
by the Kamo River?

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,420
Again?

96
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,880
Ryoko and the rest say
they'll come if you do.

97
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,530
The professor also says you
should come more often.

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,580
Alright, I see.

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,030
It's not bad to drink outside,
given the opportunity.

100
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,670
Well...

101
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,110
You're very talented, though it's not
good for you to underestimate the importance
of communication between people.

102
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,490
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,190
By the way, Fuyutsuki-kun...

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,140
...there's a student who wrote an
interesting report on biotechnology.

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,060
A student named Ikari...
do you know the name?

106
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,390
Ikari?  No.

107
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,180
I told Ikari about you.  She
said, "I wish to see him."

108
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,800
You'll be contacted by her.
Please see this student.

109
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,450
Her name is Ikari-kun.  I understand.

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,070
Metaphysical Biology
First Research Lab - Fuyutsuki

111
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,170
I've read this.

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,650
I have two or three questions, although
it's quite a stimulating report.

113
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,330
Thank you very much.

114
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,610
You are Ikari Yui-kun.

115
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,540
Yes.

116
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,940
What are you going to do from here?  Are you
going to join some commercial company...

117
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,680
...or maybe join this lab?

118
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,160
I hadn't considered that.

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,430
And, there may be a third choice.

120
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm also thinking about getting married.

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,260
I mean, if I meet a nice person.

122
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,460
AD 2015
Again

123
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,510
Incorporating the S2 unit into itself,
it's obtained the ultimate existence.

124
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,430
Evangelion Unit 01.

125
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,090
A living god created by us.
It's blasphemy.

126
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,560
The creation of a god is not allowed.

127
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,150
I won't allow him to have a god.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Ikari Gendo, can we trust you?

129
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,460
Rokubungi Gendo?
Well, I've heard the name.

130
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,060
AD 1999
Again

131
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,020
Well, I've never met him...

132
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,430
...though he generates a lot of rumors.

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,300
Kyoto Prefecture Police Office

134
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,850
Eh?  I was appointed as his advisor.

135
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,180
Yes, I'll visit him.
When is a good time?

136
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,850
I've heard rumors about you from people.
I've been wanting to meet you.

137
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,080
You were drunk and got into a fight.
That's so pathetic.

138
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,110
Before I had said anything, they
picked on me for no reason.

139
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,330
I'm not used to being liked.
I am used to being hated.

140
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,370
That's not my concern.

141
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,670
Fuyutsuki-sensei, you're exactly the
kind of person that I expected.

142
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,650
<i>My first impression of him was
that he was a real bastard.</i>

143
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,520
<i>In those days, this country still
had seasons.  It was autumn.</i>

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,190
Is that true?

145
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,820
Yes.  I'm going with Rokubungi-san.

146
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,580
<i>When I heard that, I
couldn't hide my surprise.</i>

147
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,110
You walk with that guy?

148
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,600
Oh, Fuyutsuki-sensei...

149
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,410
...he's such a cute man...

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,330
...it's just that no one knows it.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,310
Ignorance can be a source of happiness.

152
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,650
I introduced you to him.
Were you disturbed by that?

153
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,620
No.  I admit that he's an interesting
guy, but I don't like him.

154
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,680
However, it was commonly accepted
by those who knew, that the objective
of his approach to Yui-kun...

155
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,460
...was her talent and the support of the
organization backing her.

156
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,630
That organization was called Seele,
according to the rumors I heard afterwards.

157
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,110
AD 2000
Antarctica

158
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,080
Second Impact...

159
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,290
...in the last year of the 20th
century, that tragedy took place.

160
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:30,810
AD 2001

161
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,550
In the first year of the 21st century,
there was nothing but time.

162
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,260
A year that had nothing else to say.

163
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,680
AD 2002

164
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,200
Aichi Prefecture -
The remains of Toyohashi City

165
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,780
They say it's going to be
another day of midsummer winter.
It's quite hot down here.

166
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,330
That's nothing new for the present Japan.

167
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,500
It's been summer for almost an
entire year now.  It takes its toll on you.

168
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,150
You're not going to move
up to the other boat?

169
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,590
You mean in the neighboring town?
That place still reeks of oil.

170
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,490
I can't get used to it.

171
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,190
Still, that's no reason to
open a practice here.

172
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,310
It took quite some time to find you.

173
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,930
They don't have enough doctors here.

174
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm just acting like one,
but it's better than no doctor at all.

175
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,970
The South Pole?  Now?!

176
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,120
An official investigation of the incident
ordered by the UN Council.

177
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,240
It's only a temporary investigation...

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,230
...but I believe you would be far more use
to the world there, rather than working
here as an unlicensed doctor.

179
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,330
Professor Fuyutsuki...

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,180
That's 'ex-professor'.

181
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,850
By the way, my column is blank...
Who recommended me?

182
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,570
Same year - Antarctica

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,760
Was this the land of ice?

184
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,640
It hardly looks it.

185
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,300
Professor Fuyutsuki...

186
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,050
Oh, it's you.  You survived?

187
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,170
I hear that you participated in
the Katsuragi investigation team.

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,100
Fortunately, I returned to Japan the day
before the incident, and I escaped that tragedy.

189
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,750
Is that so?  Rokubungi-kun...

190
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,010
Excuse me, I changed my surname.

191
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,310
A postcard?  Not a business card?

192
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,800
We have married.

193
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,800
Ikari Yui
& Gendo

194
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,800
It's been a long time!
How are you?

195
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,710
Ikari!  Ikari Gendo!

196
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,080
My wife asked me to give you this.
She's a fan of yours.

197
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm honored.

198
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,080
Ikari Yui & Gendo

199
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,080
a long time!
How are you?

200
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,870
How is Yui-kun?  Isn't she
participating in this expedition?

201
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,250
She wanted to come,
but we have a child now.

202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,660
Your organization, Seele or whatever,
is creating a lot of bad rumors.

203
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,110
I don't like the way that it controls
the committee by force.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
You're still too scrupulous.

205
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,820
In this age, no honest
organization can survive.

206
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,950
If this official investigation commission
were composed only of Seele personnel,
there would be a lot of trouble.

207
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,110
Were we assigned to avoid trouble?

208
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,580
AD 2015

209
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,920
Nerv Headquarters - 4th Isolation Ward

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,260
I still hate the darkness.  It brings
memories of nothing but horrible things.

211
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,240
Who is she?

212
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,120
The only survivor of the investigation commission.

213
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,110
AD 2002

214
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,140
South Pole Observatory Ship -
2nd Isolation Ward

215
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,370
Her name is Katsuragi Misato.

216
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,990
Katsuragi?  Is she
the daughter of Dr. Katsuragi?

217
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,470
Yes.  She hasn't spoken for two years.

218
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,120
How terrible.

219
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,890
She witnessed that hell.

220
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,410
Her physical injuries healed, but
mental injuries are hard to fix.

221
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,740
That's right.

222
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,950
It's difficult to figure out the
results of this investigation.

223
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,270
A change in atmospheric components
over a perfectly defined area...

224
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,910
The complete extermination of all
life right down to microorganisms....

225
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,060
The remains of a giant underground
cavity below the blast center...

226
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,030
And this giant of light...

227
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,870
This incident is surrounded by mysteries.

228
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,580
Afterwards, the United Nations officially
declared that the Second Impact was caused
by a massive meteor collision.

229
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,790
However, to me, that was obviously
fabricated information.

230
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,270
Behind it, there was Seele
and the man named Kihl.

231
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,050
I tried to find out the truth
about that incident...

232
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,250
AD 2003
Hakone

233
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,350
...even if the name "Ikari Yui"
was involved.

234
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,360
The Artificial Evolution Lab.
Under the direct control of the United Nations.

235
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,840
It's been a while.

236
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,540
Yes, it has.

237
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,640
Why do you hide the
existence of the giant?

238
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,110
You already knew that Second Impact
was going to happen, didn't you?

239
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,710
You told me that you returned the
day before the incident.

240
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,810
Was it also just good fortune that you returned
with all of the research results as well?

241
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,540
I didn't expect that these sort of
things would have escaped destruction.

242
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,580
I investigated your estate in detail.

243
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,470
I understand you need a lot of money to
educate a child.  But the amount was too
great to be possessed by one person.

244
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,380
Oh, the great Professor Fuyutuski.  How
about moving to the economics faculty?

245
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,020
I'll publish the truth behind Second Impact,
you, Seele, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

246
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,180
I can't forgive the people who caused that.

247
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,570
As you wish.

248
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,010
But before that, I have
one thing to show you.

249
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,930
We're getting down very deep.

250
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,480
Are you worried?

251
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,790
Slightly.

252
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,200
What is this?

253
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:44,050
We didn't create it.  Someone left this cavity
behind, although 89% has been buried.

254
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,210
Then, this was originally a
spherical underground space.

255
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,790
Just like the underground
cavity in Antarctica?

256
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,130
The data is almost identical.

257
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,570
Do you intend to bring
about that tragedy...

258
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,750
...again?!

259
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,380
Why don't you see for yourself.

260
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,430
This is the installation which is
consuming all that humanity has.

261
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,400
Oh, Fuyutsuki-sensei!

262
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,860
Akagi-kun, you're here too?

263
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:27,200
Yeah.  This is the best place to investigate
the fundamental theory of the bio-computer
which we are attempting to create.

264
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm going to name them the Magi.

265
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,900
Magi, the three wise men from the east?

266
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,850
Is this what you wanted to show me?

267
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,510
No.  This way.

268
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,600
Ritsuko, I'll be back soon.

269
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,410
This is...

270
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,290
Is this that giant?

271
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,110
We of Gehirn call that object Adam.

272
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,190
This is different.

273
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,420
Then...

274
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,270
Yes, the Adam created by humans, Eva.

275
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,330
Eva?

276
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,080
Our project to revive Adam is referred to
as Project E.  This is the model for the
project, Eva Unit 00.

277
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,470
The prototype of a god?

278
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,520
Fuyutsuki, let us create a new
era for humanity, together.

279
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,160
AD 2015

280
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,890
Umm, senpai...

281
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,420
Oh, sorry.  Let's hurry with Rei's re-test.

282
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,150
I haven't seen Katsuragi-san today.

283
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,690
Well, neither have I.

284
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,790
Katsuragi-san?

285
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,390
Yeah, Katsuragi Misato,
nice to meet you.

286
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,320
AD 2005
Second New Tokyo City

287
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,430
Mom, the other day, I happened
to meet a girl named Katsuragi.

288
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,830
University of Second Tokyo Campus

289
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,670
People always stare at me from a distance.

290
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,930
It forces me to remember the
importance of your name.

291
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,710
She's different.  She's really
honest, even with me.

292
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,060
I hear that she is the only survivor
from the investigation commission.

293
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,980
It seems that she was once mute.

294
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,740
But now she is quite talkative, like
she's trying to make up for those days.

295
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,420
Rit-chan, I'm always underground.

296
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,260
I'm tired of having the box
lunches they provide.

297
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,030
On the surface, the construction
of the Third Tokyo City has started, as a
result of the second capital transfer plan.

298
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,190
For a couple of days, Misato was absent
from school.  I forced her to tell me why.
She's such an idiot!

299
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,690
She had been at her apartment, in bed
with her boyfriend for a whole week!

300
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,240
I was impressed to hear
about another side of her.

301
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,810
Today, she introduced me to the guy.

302
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,210
He's handsome, but I'm
not used to his frivolity.

303
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,600
You've been afraid of boys
for a long time, Rit-chan.

304
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,620
That's because you were
only brought up by a mother.

305
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,880
Sorry, I've always let you do as you liked.

306
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,230
I'm terrible.  I'm your mother
only when I wish to be.

307
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,660
Mother...

308
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,620
AD 2003

309
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Hakone - Lake Ashinoko Levee

310
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,440
The same weather day after day...

311
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,190
The disappearance of autumn from
this country is sad beyond words.

312
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,860
According to the scenario in Seele's secret
Dead Sea Scrolls, Third Impact will definitely
occur in a little over ten years.

313
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,210
Seele and Gehirn - organizations
for preventing the final tragedy.

314
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,100
I support your intentions, not Seele's.

315
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,460
Fuyutsuki-sensei, it would be terribly
dangerous to break that seal onto the world.

316
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,240
I've given all the materials to Ikari.
It's not something one can do alone.

317
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,450
We won't repeat what happened last time.

318
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,940
Oh, and I've also been given a warning...

319
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,460
It seems that it would be no
trouble at all for them to erase me.

320
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,580
And those who survived as well.
It's easy to exterminate people.

321
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,630
Still, that's no reason for
you to become a test subject.

322
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,900
Everything happens as it must.

323
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,680
That's why I'm with Seele,
for Shinji's sake...

324
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,020
AD 2004

325
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,490
Hakone - Second Underground
Experimental Installation

326
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,190
Why is there a child in here?

327
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,440
This is Chief Ikari's son.

328
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,940
Ikari, this is not a day school.
This is a very important day.

329
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,680
Sorry, Fuyutsuki-sensei.
I brought him here.

330
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,050
Yui-kun, it's your experiment today.

331
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,360
That's why.  I want to show the
promising future to my child.

332
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,460
Those were the last words from Yui-san.

333
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,590
A freak accident erased her from this world.

334
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,040
Just as I had wished.

335
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,750
What a disgusting woman I am.

336
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,560
Rit-chan, after that day, Chief
Ikari completely changed.

337
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:19,430
GLASS

338
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,160
Where were you this week?

339
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,250
I know you're depressed...

340
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,650
...but your body doesn't
belong only to yourself.

341
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,390
I know.  Fuyutsuki, today I'm
starting a new project.

342
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,810
I've already made the proposal
to Chairman Kihl.

343
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,770
You're going to do it?

344
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,980
Right.  The way to become a god,
which no one has achieved.

345
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,120
The Human Instrumentality Project.

346
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,500
AD 2008

347
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,580
Mom, congratulations on completing
the basic theory behind the Magi.

348
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,100
I have good news, to congratulate you with.

349
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,110
It has been informally decided
that I will officially join Gehirn.

350
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,590
Starting next month, I will
be engaged in Project E.

351
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,560
Who are you?

352
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,830
Akagi Ritsuko of the Technology
Development Division.  This is my ID.

353
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,920
I hear that the basic installation of the
Command Center has been completed,
so I came here to see it.

354
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,450
Well, it's just like a maze in here.

355
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,390
The Chief and Doctor Akagi will
see you in the Command Center.

356
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,270
Are you really all right?

357
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,780
I don't have regrets about my job.

358
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,720
You lie!  You still remember Yui-san.

359
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,710
But that's fine with me.

360
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,950
AD 2010

361
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,350
Geofront - Artificial Dome Portion

362
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,390
Lower Level, 2nd Direct Support Area
(Planned Site)

363
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,980
That's Gehirn Headquarters.

364
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,980
Chief, good morning.

365
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,710
Did you bring your child?

366
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,600
Oh, but it was a son...

367
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,930
This isn't Shinji.  I decided to take
care of an acquaintance's child.

368
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,870
Her name is Ayanami Rei.

369
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,860
Rei-chan, hello.

370
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,660
<i>This child looks like someone.</i>

371
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,530
<i>Yui-san?!</i>

372
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,470
All the files concerning Ayanami
Rei have already been deleted.

373
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,940
White paper.

374
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,540
What does this mean?

375
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,850
Completed

376
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,180
Magus Casper...

377
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,650
Magus Balthasar...

378
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,250
Magus Melchior...

379
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,770
The Magi are three of myself.

380
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,450
Me as a scientist, me as a
mother, and me as a woman.

381
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
These three are in conflict with each other.

382
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,830
Three moms.

383
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,410
The only thing you have to
do is to switch the power on.

384
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,200
Today, I'll be leaving early.
Misato is coming back.

385
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,050
Oh, yes, I heard she joined Gehirn.

386
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,800
In Germany, as I remember.

387
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes.  The third branch office.

388
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,000
A long distance relationship?

389
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,790
I hear that they broke up.

390
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,110
Oh, they seemed to be such a good couple.

391
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,430
Things between man and woman are difficult
to understand, because they're not logical.

392
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,410
You're always cold about such things.

393
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,640
You might lose your happiness.

394
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,980
The definition of happiness is
even more difficult to figure out.

395
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,090
Well, it's been a while since
I went out to drink.

396
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,680
Good work.

397
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,820
Good work.

398
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,240
What?  Do you have something
to ask me, Rei-chan?

399
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,300
I've lost my way.

400
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,030
Oh, then let's leave together.

401
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:31,840
No need.

402
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,570
But you can't get back by yourself.

403
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,790
That's none of your business, hag.

404
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,120
What?

405
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,230
I can get home by myself.
Leave me alone, hag.

406
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,820
You shouldn't call someone a hag.

407
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,720
You are a hag, aren't you?

408
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,650
I'm getting angry!  I'll ask
Chief Ikari to scold you.

409
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,490
It's the Chief who calls you that.

410
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,290
That's...

411
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,960
That hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless.

412
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,760
That hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless.

413
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,730
hag...  hag...

414
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,320
That hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless.

415
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,100
It's the Chief who calls you that.

416
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,020
...that hag is stubborn.

417
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,540
...useless...  useless...

418
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,180
You're useless, because there are
substitutes even if you die, Rei.

419
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,730
You're the same as me.

420
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,240
The Human Instrumentality Committee,
chaired by Kihl Lorentz...

421
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,370
...immediately dissolved the
research organization Gehirn.

422
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,780
In order to carry out the whole project,
the special institute Nerv was established.

423
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,060
And we all moved to Nerv,
except for one person...

424
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,190
...who had rendered remarkable
service to the Magi system, Dr. Akagi.

425
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,510
AD 2015

426
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,060
Well...  here I go.

427
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,210
It's you.

428
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,340
Yes, it is.

429
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,340
It's been awhile.  The guards are sleeping.

430
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,060
This action will result in your death.

431
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,910
All I want is to get closer to the truth...

432
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,570
...within me.

433
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,500
Besides, it seems they're catching on
to the fact that I smuggled the Adam
sample for Commander Ikari.

434
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,180
If I don't start looking out for myself,
things could be looking grim...  for me.

435
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,580
Thank you for your cooperation.

436
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,190
Oh, this soon?

437
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes.  The case was solved.

438
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,080
I see.

439
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,110
How is he?

440
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,370
I have no idea.

441
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,110
Yo, you're late.

442
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,190
I'm back.

443
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,950
Katsuragi, it's me.

444
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,690
I'm sure you're listening to this message,
after I caused you so much trouble.

445
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,690
Sorry.

446
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,060
Please tell Rit-chan "I'm sorry".

447
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,140
And there's one more thing to trouble
you with.  I've been growing flowers.

448
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,140
I'd appreciate it if you
could water them for me.

449
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,760
Shinji-kun knows where they are.

450
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,420
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
Don't hesitate.  Move ahead!

451
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,710
If I can see you again, I'll say the
words that I couldn't say 8 years ago.

452
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,420
Bye.

453
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,570
It's 2 minutes past 2.

454
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,750
Idiot.

455
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,440
You're such an idiot.

456
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,260
That time, I did nothing but
run away from Misato-san.

457
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,580
There was nothing else I could do.

458
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,210
Nothing I could say, since I'm a child.

459
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,100
That's what I realized.

Surpassed by Shinji again, Asuka falls into a dark pit of despair,

467
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:10,380
and damage from the next Angel attack is even more horrifying.

468
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Shinji can find no words to soothe her shattered soul.
