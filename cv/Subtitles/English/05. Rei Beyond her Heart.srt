NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,500
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,900
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:38,000
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,200
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,600
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,700
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,900
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,300
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,100
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

Connect main power
supply to all circuits.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,400
Main power supply connected.
Activation system operating.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,000
Operational voltage,
critical point in...0.5, 0.2...

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,900
It's reached.

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,200

Pulses transmitted.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
All circuits are normal.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,800
Initial contact;
no problems.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,500

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,800
Troubles occurring
in the third phase.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Rejection is setting into
the central nerve elements.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Stop the contacts.
Release the circuits up to No.6.

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,500
I can't !
It's not receiving the signals !

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Unit 00 is out of control !

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Abort the experiment.
Turn off the power supply.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes, sir !

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
Unit 00 has switched
to back-up power.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Thirty-five seconds
til complete shutdown.

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
It's dangerous !
Step back !

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Auto ejection has been initiated !

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
No !

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
Complete
shutdown in...

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,300
Special Bakelite !
Hurry !

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,400
Rei !

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,100
Rei, are you all right ?

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,500
Rei ?!

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,500
Good.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
Episode 5
Rei,
Beyond Her Heart

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,100
Ayanami Rei, 14 years old....

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,200
...the so called ``First Child'' is the first testee discovered based on the Marduk Report.

62
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,300
She's the exclusive pilot
of Evangelion Prototype Unit 00.

63
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Her personal history was started anew and all her records were already erased.

64
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,200
Well, what was the cause of the accident during the last experiment ?

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
It's still unknown.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,600
But the primary cause is thought to be a mental instability in the pilot.

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,500
Mental instability ?
In Rei ?

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Yes. She was disturbed much
more than we had thought.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,700
What happened ?

70
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,100
I don't know.
But she might have ...

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Do you have any ideas ?

72
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
No, that can't be...

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,900
Demolition of
Block-D3 completed.

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,600
Please submit all data to Analyzing Group of 1st Division, Engineering Bureau.

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,300
This is our enemy,
isn't it  ?

76
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,900
I see. It retains the
original form except its core.

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,500
This is truly an ideal sample.
I really appreciate it.

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,700
Well, did you
find something ?

79
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,400
What's this ?

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,100
It's the code number,
meaning insolubility.

81
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,500
In other words, you don't
know anything at all, do you ?

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
No.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,300
The Angel is composed of matter which has the properties of both particle and wave, like light.

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, you found its
power source, didn't you ?

85
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,800
Something like that. But I've got nothing on its working mechanisms.

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,900
We only confirmed that there're so many unknowns in this world, right  ?

87
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,500
Anyway, the world
is full of mysteries.

88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,400
For example, look at this particular wave pattern of the Angel.

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Let me see.

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,900
This is...

91
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Yes. Although the constituent elements are different...

92
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,100
...the arrangement and coordinates of the signals are very similar to that of humans.

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Around 99.89%.

94
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,000
99.89% means...

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,500
This reveals how limited
our intelligence is.

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,300
OK. All right.
Stop !

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
This is the core...
What about the rest ?

98
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,800
Degradation is very serious. It has too many problems to be used as a sample.

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
That's alright. Throw away
all the other parts.

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,800
What's the matter ?

102
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
Um...no...nothing special.

103
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,200
Listen, when you say ``Nothing,'' with such a face...

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,400
...you look to me like you're saying ``Think about me. Please, worry about me.''

105
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Well, Father seems to have
gotten a burn on his hand.

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,800
Burn ?

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,500
I wonder what
happened to him.

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,400
Burn...Do you
know about that ?

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Before you arrived, Unit 00 went out of control during the activation experiment.

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,900
You've heard about it,
haven't you  ?

111
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,600
Yes.

112
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,400
The pilot was locked
inside at that time.

113
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,000
The pilot was Ayanami,
wasn't it ?

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Commander Ikari helped her get out.
He forced the overheated hatch open.

115
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,600
Father did...

116
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
That was when he got
the burn on his palm.

117
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
Go for it, Hideko !

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,900
Now, let's sink a shot !

119
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Alright !

120
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,300
All the chicks got
gorgeous breasts.

121
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Somehow Suzuhara's
eyes look indecent.

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Hey, sir ! What are you
looking at so eagerly ?

123
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,000
Er, nothing particularly.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Ayanami, by any chance ?

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
N...no.

126
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, c'mon.
You can't fool me.

127
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,100
Ayanami's bust, Ayanami's
thighs and Ayanami's...

128
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
...calves !

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,300
Like I said,
that's not it.

130
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
What were you
looking at, then ?

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't try and
avoid the question.

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Well, I was wondering
why she's always alone.

133
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,700
Come to think, she hasn't made any friends since she came here for first grade.

134
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,600
I don't know why, but everyone
thinks she's unapproachable.

135
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,600
The truth is, she might
have a bad attitude.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,100
Both of you are
Eva pilots, right ?

137
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,400
So you know more about her than the rest of us, don't you ?

138
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,500
That's right.

139
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
We hardly speak
to each other.

140
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,000
Eva Unit 01 will be in
the third cooling phase.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Please shut down all systems
of Cage 06 up to phase 3.

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,700
No problems with the last harmonics and synchronization tests.

143
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,100
All numerical
conditions satisfied.

144
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Roger. Report the
results to Balthazar.

145
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Roger.

146
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Copy the personal data of the entry plug to Melchior in all ranges. I'm sending the data.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,900
Melchior, roger.
Circuits connected.

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
The third cooling
phase is starting.

149
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
CBL circulation is started.

150
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,200
Send the wastewater to the
second water purification system.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,000
The conditions of all
protein walls are normal.

152
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,500
Minus 1,050 minutes until
Unit 00 reactivation experiment.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,900
What's this ?!

154
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,400
Curry.

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,000
You're eating
instant, as usual.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,500
You've been invited to dinner,
so you shouldn't complain !

157
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,900
Misato ?

158
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, me...

159
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
Ta da.

160
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Put it into this.

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
Are you serious ?

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Why not ?
This is very good.

163
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Alright...

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,500
You can't have this kind of taste with a curry-flavored cup'a'noodle.

165
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,100
I'll help myself.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,700
It's a knack to keep the soup base and hot water less than usual.

167
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,100
Misato cooked this,
didn't she ?

168
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes.

169
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
Oh, you noticed ?

170
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
From the taste.

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,300
How could she
mess up instant food...?

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,900
If you invite me again, please call me on the day Shinji's cooking.

173
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Shinji, you'd better move.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You shouldn't spoil your life under the influence of a rude roommate.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,100
I've gotten used to it.

176
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,000
He's right, Ritsuko. Don't underestimate a human's ability to adapt to its environment.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Besides, if he moves...

178
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh...Shinji,
one more, please.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,900
Okay.

180
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
He'd have to follow
troublesome procedures.

181
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Shinji's only got the
formal security card, you know ?

182
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh, I nearly forgot.
Shinji, I have a favor to ask you.

183
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
What is it ?

184
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Ayanami Rei's new card.

185
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
I missed the chance
to give it to her.

186
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry, but could you deliver it to her home on your way to headquarters ?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,900
Sure.

188
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,900
What's the matter ? You're looking at Rei's photo very intently.

189
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,600
Ah...no.

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Shin, could you be... ?

191
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,100
No !

192
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,200
Come on.
You look so embarrassed.

193
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
You've got an official excuse to go to Rei's home. It's a nice chance, right ?

194
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Stop teasing me !

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,600
You're worth teasing
because of your quick temper.

196
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
Just like Misato.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,300
I just thought that I know so little about her, even though we're both the pilots of Eva...

198
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,400
She's a good girl, and like your father,
she isn't good at it, though.

199
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
She isn't good at...
What ?

200
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,400
Living.

201
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,500
NEON GENESIS

202
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Excuse me.

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,700
Excuse me. It's Ikari.

204
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,500
Ayanami, I'm coming in.

205
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Are these Ayanami's...?

206
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,400
I, um...

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
I didn't really...

208
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,100
Won't you move ?

209
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
I...um...

210
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
What is it ?

211
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,400
Well, I...

212
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,200
I...was...asked...

213
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
I mean...What was that...?
The card, the card...

214
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,300
Your card's been renewed, and I was asked to bring it to you.

215
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,200
So, that's why...
I wasn't going to do...

216
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,900
Ritsuko told me that she'd
forgotten to give it to you.

217
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,900
It's true. But no one answered when I rung the doorbell and the door was unlocked...

218
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Central Dogma is open now.
Please use the 4th entry gate.

219
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,400
Here's the new one
Ritsuko asked me to bring.

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,900
About what ?

222
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, I heard that you're going to try the reactivation experiment today.

223
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I hope it'll be
successful this time.

224
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,800
Say, aren't you afraid of getting into that Unit 00 again ?

225
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Why ?

226
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,400
I heard that you were injured during the last experiment, so I wondered if you felt alright.

227
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,700
You're Commander Ikari's son,
aren't you ?

228
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,900
Yes.

229
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,600
Don't you trust
your father's work ?

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Of course not.
Not from a father like him.

231
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,700
Um...

232
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Rei, are you
all right ? Rei !

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,400
The pilot was locked
inside at that time.

234
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,300
Commander Ikari helped her get out.
He forced the overheated hatch open.

235
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
That's when he got
the burn on his palm.

236
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,100
Rei, can you hear me ?

237
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,700
Yes.

238
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,900
We're going to try reactivating Unit 00.
Start the first connection.

239
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
Connect main
power supply.

240
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,800
Voltage has exceeded
the critical point.

241
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,500
Roger. Move the
format to Phase II.

242
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,700
The pilot's
connecting to Unit 00.

243
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,400
The circuits are opening.

244
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
The conditions of pulses
and harmonics are normal.

245
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,100
There are no problems
with synchronization.

246
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,800
All nerve links are finished.
Nerve center devices are operational.

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,100
No error in
recalculated tolerances.

248
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,400
Checklist,
up to 2590, cleared.

249
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600

0.1.

261
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,400
It's passed.
Borderline cleared.

262
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Unit 00 has activated.

263
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,100
Roger. I'll start an
interlocking test without a break.

264
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Ikari, an unidentified object's approaching.
I think it's the fifth Angel.

265
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,900
Interrupt the test.
All hands on first class alert.

266
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Why don't you
use Unit 00 ?

267
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,400
It's not ready for combat yet.
How's Unit 01 ?

268
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,700
It'll take 380 seconds
to prepare it.

269
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Move it out.

270
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,400
Aye, sir.

271
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Rei, we succeeded in
reactivating. Come back.

272
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,100
The target has
flown over Tonosawa.

273
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,200
Unit 01 begin
preparations for launch.

274
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,800
Release the first lock bolt.

275
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,500
Release confirmed.

276
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
Roger. Release the
second binding.

277
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,900
Roger.

278
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,600
The target has arrived in the area over Lake Ashino.

279
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,700
Eva Unit 01 is
ready for launch.

280
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,300
Launch !

281
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,700
A powerful energy reaction
detected inside the target !

282
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,800
What ?!

283
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,900
Accelerating to its outer
rim and converging.

284
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Could it be...?!

285
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,700
No, get out of the way !

286
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,300

Rei gives him
