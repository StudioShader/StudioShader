NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,500
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,500
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:37,000
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,200
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,600
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,700
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,900
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,300
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,700
Good morning, Shinji.
How are you ?

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,800
I've gotten used to it...
I think nothing's wrong.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,600
That's fine. Exit points,
emergency power source...

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,300
...locations of armed buildings and recovery spots.

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
Can you remember
all of them ?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Maybe...

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,500
Well, I'll review
the lesson again.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,300
Eva usually works off an
electric power supply cable.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,000
If Eva uses its internal battery in an emergency...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,700
...it'll only function one minute at full strength or five minutes at most, even with Gain.

26
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,800
You understand ?

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,900
Yes.

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, let's resume the Induction Mode lesson where we left off yesterday.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Aim at the target in the center of the sights...switch on.

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,100
Stay calm. Aim at the
center of the target.

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,200
Switch...

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,900
Next !

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Say, I wonder how Shinji
brought himself to pilot it.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,700
He goes along with what
others say obediently...

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,000
...it's how he copes
with his life, isn't it ?

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,700
Aim at the center of the target, switch...

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Aim at the center of the target, switch...

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,400
Aim at the center of the target, switch...

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,900
Aim at the center of the target, switch...

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Aim at the center of the target...

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,500
Episode 3:
A Phone
That
Never Rings.

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,300
Misato, it's morning already.

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,700
I was on night duty
until a little while ago.

44
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,500
I don't have to go to the
office until this evening.

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,100
So, please let me sleep.

46
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,000
Then, I...

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Is it Thursday ?
Burnable garbage, please.

48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
Okay.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
Have you gotten
used to school ?

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Yes.

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,900
Good. Take care.

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,100
See you later.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes, hello.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,800
How have you been ?
Are you getting along with him ?

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,900
Him ? Oh, Shinji. It's been two weeks since he transferred schools.

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,800
He's still the same.
He never gets any telephone calls.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Telephone calls ?

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,100
As it's a necessity, I gave him a portable one a long time ago.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,400
He doesn't seem to have used it or received a phone call from anyone.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,400
I wonder if he
has any friends.

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,100
He seems to have a poor personality for making friends, doesn't he ?

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Have you heard the story of
the ``Hedgehog's Dilemma'' ?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Hedgehogs ?
The thorny ones ?

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:06,100
Even if they want to warm each other, the closer they get, the more they hurt each other.

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,500
Humans are the same.

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,000
Shinji must be afraid of getting hurt, so he acts timid.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,700
After he grows up and gets closer to and stays away from someone...

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,400
...he'll learn the proper distance to maintain to avoid hurting each other.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
What is it, Class Rep ?

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Did you take care
of yesterday's printout ?

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,400
Ah, well, there didn't seem to be anybody at Touji's house.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Aida, you're on good terms with Suzuhara, aren't you ?

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Why aren't you
worried about him ?

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm not sure, but he
may have been hurt.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,500
In that robot incident ?
The TV said that nobody was hurt...

77
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,400
No way ! You saw the center of the explosion, didn't you ?

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,500
Not only the units of Iruma and Komatsu but also Misawa and Kyushu were sent out.

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm sure that there were more than 10 or 20 people injured. Some might've been killed...

80
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,700
Touji !

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,900
Suzuhara !

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,600
Yo ! The number of students seems to have dropped drastically.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,300
Evacuation, evacuation. Many have transferred to other schools.

84
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,200
It's not surprising. There was a real battle within the city.

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,000
You're the only guy who's happy to see real battle.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,900
I guess.
How have you been ?

87
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,300
You've been absent a long time.
Were you involved in the incident ?

88
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,700
My younger sister...

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,700
She was buried under
a heap of rubble.

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,800
She survived, but has been in the hospital since then.

91
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,700
My father and grandfather work for the research center.

92
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,000
They can't leave work. If I didn't stay with her she'd be all alone.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,300
Anyway, the pilot of
that robot really sucked !

94
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,400
I'm really pissed.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,900
A robot on our side destroyed the city ! What was he doing ?!

96
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,500
Did you hear the rumor
about the transfer student ?

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Transfer student ?

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,400
Him. He transferred to this school while you were gone.

99
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,500
It was just
after the incident.

100
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Don't you think
that's strange ?

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
All rise !

102
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,400
The hardest trials for the human race began then.

103
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
In the last year of the 20th century...

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,800
...a massive meteor, from deep space, fell on the Antarctic Continent.

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,600
It caused the continent's
ice to melt rapidly.

106
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,800
As the result, the water
level of the oceans rose...

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
...the Earth's axis fluctuated
and abnormal weather...

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,300
...which threatened the existence of all living things occurred around the world.

109
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,400
We call this
the Second Impact.

110
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,700
Economic collapse, racial disputes and civil wars. The survivors suffered all kinds of hell.

111
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,400
``Is it true that you're the pilot of that robot ? Y/N''

112
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:26,100
But 15 years later...only 15 years, we have revived the world a great deal.

113
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,100
This result is not only due to the excellence of the human race...

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
``It's true, isn't it ? Y/N''

115
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:40,700
...but to the blood, sweat, tears and effort of your fathers and mothers.

116
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,000
In those days, I lived in Nebukawa.
It is already...

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Hey, everybody ! We're still in class, aren't we ? Take your seats !

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,500
You're always trying
to take control !

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,400
It's okay, it's okay.

120
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
No, it's not !

121
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
How were you selected ?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Did you have any examinations ?

123
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,600
Were you frightened ?

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
What's the cockpit like ?

125
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,900
Well, uh, I have to
keep such things secret...

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
What's the name
of the robot ?

127
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm not sure, but they
call it Eva or Unit 01...

128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Eva ?

129
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,500
What's its deadly attack ?

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
It's some knife and the vibrations...
like an ultrasonic wave...

131
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Anyway, that's amazing ! He's the pride of our school, isn't he ?

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,100
Great !

133
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,500
Consequently...

134
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, so much for today.

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
All rise ! Bow !

136
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,900
Hey, everybody ! At least
do it properly at the end of...

137
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Sorry, transferee. But I had to hit you. I couldn't be satisfied unless I hit you.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Sorry, but his younger sister got hurt in the battle. That's the reason.

139
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Speaking for myself,
I'm not doing it by choice.

140
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,600
An emergency call...
I'll go on ahead...

141
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,100
A special state of
emergency now exists...

142
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,700
...for the Kanto and Chubu districts around the Tokai area.

143
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,400
Please take refuge in designated shelters. I repeat....

144
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,900
NEON GENESIS

145
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,000
The target has been acquired optically.
It has invaded territorial waters.

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
All hands to
battle stations !

147
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,200
Roger. Prepare
anti-aircraft batteries !

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Tokyo-3 is transforming
to battle formation.

149
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
House the central block !

150
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,000
The central block and
District 1 to 7 have been housed.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,100
The government and all ministries concerned have been notified.

152
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,900
Present anti-aircraft interception
system effectiveness is 48%.

153
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,200
What's the status of
noncombatants and civilians ?

154
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
The evacuation has
been reported complete.

155
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,300
Primary and junior high school students,
please stay in your class.

156
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,800
Residents, please stay
in your block.

157
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,800
Again ?!

158
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,100
There're only letters
on the screen again.

159
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,300
News blackout. They won't
show us civilians anything at all.

160
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Although this is
such a big event...

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The 4th Angel shows up when Commander Ikari is absent. It's sooner than I expected.

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,500
The last one came after a 15 year interval. This one after only 3 weeks.

163
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,700
They never think about our circumstances, do they ? They're the type women hate.

164
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
They're just
wasting taxes.

165
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,400
The committee is requesting that we mobilize Evangelion again.

166
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,000
How annoying. We'd mobilize it even if they didn't ask.

167
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Entry has begun.

168
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,500
Charge LCL.

169
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
Release Arrival/Departure Lock.

170
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
My father isn't here,
so why am I still piloting it ?

171
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,700
I was hit, too...

172
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,100
Hey, I have something
to talk to you about...

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
What is it ?

174
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah, well...you know.

175
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, alright.

176
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,400
Class Rep !

177
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,000
What ?

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,900
Both of us are
going to the toilet.

179
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,900
Come on ! You should
have done that earlier.

180
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Well, what is it ?

181
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,100
I want to see it, even
if it's only once before I die.

182
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,400
The battle ?

183
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know if the
next enemy will come...

184
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Kensuke, you're something else !

185
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,900
If I miss this chance, I might never...
Say, help me unlock the gate.

186
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,500
If you go out,
you'll be killed.

187
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,700
We don't know if we're safe here,
so I want to go see it.

188
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,100
You moron. What do you
think Nerv is for ?

189
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
What do you think the fighting machine of Nerv is ?

190
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
The robot which
the transferee pilots.

191
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Last time, he protected us.
But you hit him. Twice at that.

192
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,900
If he doesn't want to pilot the robot, we'll all be killed.

193
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,700
You have a duty to
watch his battle, don't you ?

194
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,900
There's no other choice.

195
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,500
You have a one
track mind, don't you ?

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Shinji, time
to launch, okay ?

197
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Alright.

198
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,400
Alright, neutralize the enemy's AT-field and fire the rifle just like you practiced.

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,500
Are you ready ?

200
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,400
Yes.

201
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,800
Launch !

202
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,400
Amazing ! It was worth the effort.
Wow, this's what I've been waiting for !

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There it is.

204
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Aim at the center of the target, switch, aim at the center of the target, switch...

205
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,700
Develop an AT-field according to the plan. OK ?

206
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Okay.

207
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,900
Idiot ! The enemy is hidden by
the explosion's smoke !

208
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Look, he's already beaten.

209
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,300
He's all right.

210
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,300
I'll send you
a spare rifle !

211
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,200
Take it !

212
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,200
Shinji, Shinji...

213
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Damn !~~I wonder if being punched affected him as badly as I thought.

214
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
S...shut up !

215
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Umbilical cable was cut !

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Eva has switched over
to internal batteries.

217
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,800
Active time remaining is
4 minutes 53 seconds !

218
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
It's coming this way !

219
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,200
Shinji, are you
all right ?! Shinji !

220
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Damage report.

221
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,000
No problem.
It's operational !

222
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
They're Shinji's classmates !

223
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,200
Why are they there ?!

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,100
Why doesn't he fight ?!

225
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,600
Because we're here...
he can't move freely.

226
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,800
Unit 01, active time remaining,
3 minutes 28 seconds !

227
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,800
Shinji, let them
into the cockpit.

228
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,200
After they're in, retreat.
Then come back later !

229
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,100
Do you think civilians are permitted into the entry plug without authorization ?!

230
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll permit it.

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're exceeding your authority,
Captain Katsuragi.

232
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,500
Unit 01, active time
remaining, 3 minutes !

233
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Maintain Eva under present orders and extend the entry plug ! Hurry up !

234
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
You two, get inside !
Quickly !

235
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
What ? It's water !

236
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
My camera.
Oh, my camera !

237
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,000
Trouble in the
nervous system !

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
It's because foreign
bodies have been inserted.

239
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,300
Noise detected in
the nervous pulses.

240
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
Now, retreat !

241
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,100
Recovery route is No. 34.

242
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,400
Go to the east
side of the mountain !

243
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,400
Transferee ! She said
``Run away,'' transferee.

244
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,200
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away...

245
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Progressive Knife drawn !

246
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Shinji, obey my orders !
Retreat !

247
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,900
Shinji !

248
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
That idiot !

249
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
Unit 01. Active time
remaining, 30 seconds...

250
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,300
Eva Unit 01 has stopped.

251
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
The target is silent.

252
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,100
Three days have already passed...

253
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,100
Since we were really
raked over the coals...

254
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,400
Since he's been absent
from school, I mean.

255
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,700
Who's he ?

256
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,100
The transferee,
the transferee.

257
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,500
I wonder how he's been ?

258
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Are you worried about him ?

259
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm not especially worried...

260
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,400
For being so tactless,
you're stubborn, aren't you ?

261
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,500
Afterwards, if you'd
said to him you're sorry...

262
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,300
...you wouldn't have suffered mental agony for three days.

263
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,100
Here's the transferee's phone number.

264
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,800
If you're worried,
try calling him.

Shinji can't overcome the weakness in his mind and even runs away from Misato.

277
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
But the organization catches him easily.
There aren't any kind words.
