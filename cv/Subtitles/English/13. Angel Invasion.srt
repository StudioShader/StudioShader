00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,500
NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,900
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,900
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,900
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Apotheosis procedure
for three Eva units...

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,500
...will begin as planned as soon as the Magi System's on line.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,200
Confirmed.
Omit from 450 to 670.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Order received.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,090
You're fast as usual, Maya.

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
That's because you
personally taught me.

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Hold it.
A8 is faster.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me do it.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
This is just like you.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,200
How're things going ? Have you finished the diagnosis on the Magi System ?

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Almost. I made it in time for today's test, just like I promised.

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,700
You're indeed Ritsuko, even though you have to deal with the three of them.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
It's already cold.

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,000
All three Magi System computers have shifted to self-analysis mode.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,900
127th periodic check,
passed without any problems.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Confirmed. Well done. Everyone,
take a break until the test begins.

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
No problem...?

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Mom's healthy as ever,
but I'm just aging, aren't I ?

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Episode 13

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Angel Invades
``shito shinnyuu''

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,900
What ?!
Undress again ?!

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,700
It's a super clean room from there.

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Just taking a shower and changing your underwear isn't enough.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Why do we have to do this for testing the auto pilot ?

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Time isn't simply passing. The technology for the Evas must keep improving.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,700
We always need fresh data.

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,500
See ?
I did what you said.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,800
Cleaned seventeen times !

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Then, all three of you, go through this room and enter the entry plug.

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,300
Don't worry. The visual monitor's turned off. Your privacy's protected.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,900
That's not the point !
I'm not comfortable with it !

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
This is a direct harmonics test without the support of the plug suit.

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,590
Asuka, that's an order.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Geez, just don't watch, okay ?

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,300
Each pilot's ready for entry.

51
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,990
Start the test.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,900
Start the test.
Auto pilot, start recording.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Insert the simulation plugs.

54
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Connect the system
to the dummy bodies.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,700
Simulation program has
handed over control to Magi.

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,900
Oh, it's pretty quick.
It's truly Magi.

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,400
It's hard to believe that the
first experiment took a week.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
The test is expected to
be completed in three hours.

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,290
How do you feel ?

60
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,790
Something's different.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Yeah, it's different from usual.

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
It's a different sensation. The right arm is clear, and all the rest is dull.

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Rei, imagine that you're
moving the right arm.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,090
Data collection's
going well.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,400
There seem to be no problems.
Change Magi back to normal.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Dilemma...?

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,800
You can guess the personality of the person who made it, can't you ?

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,100
What are you saying ?
You made it, didn't you ?

70
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,300
You don't know anything.

71
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,400
Well, unlike me, you don't
talk about yourself.

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,390
True.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,100
I upgraded the system.

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,200
My mother created the
logic base and architecture.

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,890
Have you confirmed it ?

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,790
Yes, I have.

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,700
This is the part that was
delivered three days ago.

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
This part is deteriorating.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
That's the 87th protein wall,
isn't it ?

80
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
When I zoom in, I can see something like a stain. I wonder what it is.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
It's corrosion, right ? Temperature and conductivity's been slightly changed.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Degradation in the sterilized
room happens often these days.

83
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,200
The deadline was pushed up sixty days,
so it had some air bubbles.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
The job on complex B
was very sloppy.

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
That part was finished
after the Angel appeared.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,500
That couldn't be helped
because everyone was tired.

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,300
Fix it by tomorrow.
Ikari's very picky.

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,390
Water leak again ?

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,800
No, it's corrosion on the
protein wall above us.

91
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,600
That's bad.
Will it affect our test ?

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,090
At this moment, no.

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Then, continue.
I can't stop this test easily.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,790
Commander Ikari's so picky.

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,290
Alright.

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,990
Synchronization point, normal.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,500
Connecting the simulation plugs to the Eva units via the simulation bodies.

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
Eva Unit 00, contact confirmed.

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Generating AT-field
at normal output.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,390
What happened ?

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,300
Contamination alert has been
issued in Sigma Unit, floor A.

102
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
87th protein wall has degraded.
It's heating up.

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,400
There's a problem
in No.6 pipe.

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
The corroded area's
expanding rapidly !

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Abort the experiment !
Disconnect No.6 pipe !

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,500
60, 38 and 39 are isolated.

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,390
More corrosion in 6-38.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,700
It's not working.
Corrosion's spreading from wall to wall.

110
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Prepare the Polysome.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Set the laser at max. power.
Fire as soon as it reaches there.

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,300
Corrosion's reached 6-58.
It's coming !

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Rei ?!

114
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,100
Rei's simulation body's moving.

115
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Impossible.

116
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,090
Corrosion still expanding.

117
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,800
It's destroying the water circulation system of the simulation body.

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,290
What about Rei ?!

119
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,290
She's alive.

120
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,900
Eject all plugs !
Fire the laser quickly !

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,690
AT-field !

122
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Impossible.

123
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,990
What's that ?

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Analysis pattern blue,
that's definitely an Angel !

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Angel...?!
You let it get in ?!

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,390
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
No need for excuses. Isolate Central Dogma and separate it from the Sigma Unit !

128
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Isolating Central Dogma and separating it from the Sigma Unit.

129
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,300
We'll isolate the box !
All personnel, evacuate !

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What're you doing ?!
Move it !

131
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Isolating the
Sigma Unit from floor E.

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,600
Close all shutters. All personnel in the corresponding sections, evacuate.

133
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,700
I know.
I'll leave it to you.

134
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,490
Stop the alarm.

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
S...stop the alarm.

136
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,900
It was a false alarm.
The sensor malfunctioned.

137
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,200
Tell that to Japan's
government and the Committee.

138
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,590
Roger.

139
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,290
The polluted area's
still growing.

140
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,000
It's expanding from the Pribnow Box to the entire area of the Sigma Unit.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,390
That's a bad location.

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,900
Yes, it's too
close to Adam.

143
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Contain the pollution within the Sigma Unit.
You can sacrifice the Geo-Front.

144
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,390
Evas' status ?

145
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,290
They're standing by
in the 7th cage.

146
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,400
As soon as the pilots
are recovered, they can go.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,100
You don't have to wait for the pilots.
Launch to the surface immediately.

148
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Unit 01 has to be the first. You can sacrifice the rest if you have to.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,790
Unit 01...?

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,200
But, without Eva, we can't
physically destroy the Angel.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,500
If Eva's contaminated before that,
everything will be over.

152
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,490
Hurry !

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Roger !

154
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Central Dogma below the Sigma Unit will be completely isolated in 60 seconds.

155
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
So, that's the Angel.
This isn't time for working.

156
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
The vacuum pump will be
activated in 30 seconds.

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Central Dogma's been completed isolated. The deep facilities were taken over by the invader.

158
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,200
Well, how will you deal with
the Angel without Eva ?

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
NEON GENESIS

160
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,500
See ? That's the border of heavy water that contains more oxygen.

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,000
It seems that
it's quite particular.

162
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The part where ozone's coming in to keep it sterilized isn't polluted.

163
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,600
That means it
hates oxygen, right ?

164
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Looks like it.

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,200
Ozone's being released.
The density's increasing.

166
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
It's working, it's working.

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Did we do it ?

168
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,800
Zero-A and zero-B seem
to be recovering.

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,900
The exterior of the
pipe's returned to normal.

170
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,400
The central part is strong.

171
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Alright, increase ozone.

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Strange...

173
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
It's expanding.

174
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Something's wrong.
It's heating up.

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,300
The polluted area's
expanding again.

176
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,000
No good,
it's totally ineffective.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
It's absorbing
ozone this time.

178
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Stop the ozone.

179
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,900
Amazing. It's evolving.

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,190
What's wrong ?!

181
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,600
The sub-computer's been hacked.
Intruder, unknown.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
At a time like this...?
Damn, I'll handle it in mode C.

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm gonna open the defensive
wall and run a dummy entrance.

184
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,990
It evaded the
dummy entrance.

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,290
Eighteen seconds to
trace the invasion.

186
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,990
Develop a defensive wall.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,390
It broke through
the defensive wall.

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm opening more
dummy entrances.

189
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
This isn't
a human's doing.

190
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Trace, successful.
It's from our facilities.

191
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,300
It's from the underground of the complex B.
It's from the Pribnow Box !

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,290
Its optical
pattern's changing.

193
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,600
The bright lines are
like an electronic circuit.

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,390
It's pretty much
like a computer.

195
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm opening
a dummy entrance.

196
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,700
Failed.
It was interrupted.

197
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,390
Cut the main cable.

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,700
Didn't work.
It doesn't accept the command.

199
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,990
Shoot the laser.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,100
The AT-field was developed,
no effect.

201
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,100
It's accessing the main bank
of the security section.

202
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,990
It's scanning
the password.

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Twelfth digit...sixteenth digit...
``D'' word, cleared.

204
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,900
It's entered the main bank
of the security section !

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,300
It's scanning in the main bank !
I can't stop it !

206
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
What's its purpose ?

207
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,300
It's searching for the main bus.
This code is...damn...

208
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,100
It's trying to invade Magi !

209
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Shut down the
input/output system.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,090
Go ahead and count !

211
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Three...two...one...

212
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I can't shut
the power off !

213
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,400
The Angel's still invading.
It's reached Melchior.

214
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,700
No, it's been taken
over by the Angel.

215
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,000
Melchior was reprogrammed
by the Angel.

216
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Self destruction was proposed by
the artificial intelligence, Melchior.

217
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,900
Rejected...rejected...rejected...

218
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
N...now, Melchior's
hacking Balthasar !

219
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Damn, it's fast !

220
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
What amazing calculation speed !

221
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,300
Change the logic mode.
Set the synchro code to 15 second cycle.

222
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Roger !

223
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
How long can we hold out ?

224
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,300
Guessing from that speed,
we have about two hours.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,100
I didn't expect Magi
to become our enemy.

226
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,300
They're micro machines
the size of bacteria.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The group of machines rapidly evolved until they acquired intelligence.

228
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,690
Evolved...?

229
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,290
Yes.

230
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,300
They're always changing, trying to become a system that can counter any situation.

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
That's very much like the cycle of life, seeking survival.

232
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,100
The most effective attack
against an enemy...

233
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,900
...that can overcome its own disadvantage and keep evolving...

234
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,100
...is to have
them ``learn'' death.

235
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,800
They have to die
along with Magi.

236
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,300
I suggest destruction
of the Magi System.

237
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,200
Impossible. To destroy Magi
means abandoning headquarters.

238
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Then, I officially request
it from the tactical section.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,800
I refuse. This problem should
be handled by the technical section.

240
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Why're you so obstinate ?!

241
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,900
This began from my mistake.

242
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,600
You're always like this, trying to handle everything by yourself.

243
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,200
You never ask others
for help, do you ?

244
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,900
If the Angel keeps evolving,
I have a winning strategy.

245
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,090
To promote the evolution ?

246
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,190
Yes.

247
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,900
The end of evolution is self destruction,
and that means death.

248
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,900
So, we just promote
its evolution, right ?

249
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
If the Angel considers an effective way to avoid death, it might choose to live with Magi.

250
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,000
But, how ?

251
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Because the object is a computer, by connecting Casper to the Angel directly...

252
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
...we can hack and send a self destruct promotion program, but...

253
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
...at the same time, we have to drop the guard against the Angel.

254
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Whether Casper's faster or the Angel's faster...it's a gamble.

255
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,390
Yes.

256
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Can you prepare the program in time ?
If Casper's infected, it's all over.

257
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,590
You have my word.

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,700
R alert announced,
R alert announced.

259
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,700
An emergency has occurred in NERV headquarters. Class D workers, evacuate.

260
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,000
What are those ?

261
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,290
These are developer's notes.

262
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Unbelievable. It's a hidden code...a hidden code for Magi.

263
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
It's a collection of
secret techniques, isn't it ?

264
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,900
I feel guilty even looking at these.
Amazing, this is int-C...

265
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,000
We can program faster
than expected with these.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,900
Thanks, Mom.
We can definitely make it.

267
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Give me a wrench.

268
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
This reminds me of
our college days.

269
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Board No.25.

270
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Why don't you tell
me a little about Magi ?

271
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,700
It's a long story,
and it's not very interesting.

272
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Do you know about the transcribed personality operating system ?

273
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, it's a system to transcribe an individual's personality...

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,800
...to the 7th generation organic computer, and make it self aware.

275
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,900
It's a technology used for controlling the Eva also, right ?

276
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,800
Magi seems to be the
first of that kind.

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,300
It's a technology which
was developed by my mother.

278
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
So, your mother's
personality was transcribed ?

279
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Yes.

280
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,100
This is my mother's
brain, so to speak.

281
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Is that why you
wanted to protect Magi ?

282
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
No. I didn't like
her very much.

283
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,200
So, I made that
decision as a scientist.

284
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,590
Here it comes !

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
It took over Balthasar !

286
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,700
The artificial intelligence
approved of self destruction.

287
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,190
It's begun ?!

288
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Self destruction will be commenced
in 02 seconds by an unanimous vote.

289
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Effective depth, minus 280,
minus 140, floor zero.

290
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Because of the current situation,
special order 582...

291
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Balthasar has entered Casper.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,090
It's getting ahead of us.

293
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
What speed...?!

294
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Twenty seconds to
self destruct.

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,190
No !

296
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Casper'll be taken
over in 18 seconds !

297
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,100
Fifteen seconds to activation
of the self destruct devices.

298
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,290
Ritsuko, hurry !

299
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,400
It'll be okay. I have about
a one second margin.

300
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Ten seconds to self-destruct.

301
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,590
One second...?

302
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It's not zero or minus.

303
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,790
Maya ?!

304
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,490
Nine seconds...

305
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,890
Eight seconds...

306
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,890
Seven seconds...

307
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,890
Six seconds...

308
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,890
Five seconds...

309
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,890
Four seconds...

310
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,890
...three seconds...

311
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,890
...two seconds...

312
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,890
...one second...

313
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Push !

314
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Self-destruct was cancelled
by the artificial intelligence.

315
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,090
Alright !

316
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Special order 582 was also cancelled. Magi system's returning to the normal mode.

317
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
R alert was cancelled,
R alert was cancelled.

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,500
All personnel, go to first alert.

319
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
What's really going on ?

320
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,300
Geez, I can't go anywhere
'cause I'm naked !

321
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,800
Someone help me now !

322
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Sigma Unit's open. Minus 03 to
resumption of the Magi system.

323
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,500
Am I already old ?
Overnight work is so hard.

324
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,900
You kept your promise again.
Good work.

325
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Thanks.

326
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
This's the first time I think
your coffee is delicious.

327
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
The night before my mother died, she said that Magi has three of her characteristics.

328
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,100
A scientist,
a mother and a woman.

329
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,000
Those three are in constant conflict with each other within Magi.

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,300
She purposefully
left human dilemma.

331
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Actually the program
was modified a little.

332
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I don't think I'll become a mother, so I don't understand that part of my mother.

333
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,800
I admired her
as a scientist...

334
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,000
...but I hated
her as a woman.

335
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,890
You're talking a lot today.

336
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Sometimes.

337
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Casper has the
pattern of a woman.

338
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,700
She kept her womanhood until the end.
It was just like her.

339

NERV and Seele manage the Human Complement Project behind the scenes.

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,190
They will revise the present
