00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,350
NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,940
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:16,010
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,410
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,540
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,280
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,650
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,070
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,150
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,350
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,820
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,580
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,100
Unit 01's synchronization
circuit has been cut.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,850
What about the
ejection signal ?

18
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,000
It's locked from inside the plug.
It won't accept it.

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,250
Shinji, you would've been
killed if he hadn't done that.

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,490
It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,460
But it's the truth.

22
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,300
Don't make me
any more angry.

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,140
There's 185 seconds left in Unit 01.
I can still destroy half of headquarters.

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,250
In his current condition,
he might really do it.

25
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,410
Shinji, listen to me !

26
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,100
Everyone might have been killed if Commander Ikari didn't make his decision.

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,330
I said it
doesn't matter !

28
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,090
Father...

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,660
...he tried to kill Touji...

30
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,350
...with my hands.

31
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,500
Episode 19

32
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,500
Man's Battle

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,040
Father, you're there,
aren't you ?!

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,090
Say something !
Answer me !

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,720
Increase LCL compression
density to maximum setting.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,950
We don't have time
for an irritated child.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,820
There's another
direct connection...

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,650
Damn it...

39
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,510
...damn it...

40
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,620
D...damn it ...

41
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,960
Dissolution of the
right breast, complete.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,910
Cleaning of body fluid will
begin from 3-0 as planned.

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,050
Part No.6 will be heated.

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,960
Are you alright ?

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,670
It's alright as long
as I can do my job.

46
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,220
I can't take a break during
this emergency situation.

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,280
What about Shinji ?

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,020
He was forcefully removed after they used the laser cutter to open the emergency hatch.

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,770
This is tough.
This time...

50
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,130
...he might not make it.

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,500
That idiot won't
be able to recover.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,700
What about Ikari ?

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,900
He's not injured, so he'll
wake up sooner or later.

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
He's probably dreaming now.

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,400
Dream...?

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,470
Yes.
Haven't you had a dream ?

57
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,980
Shinji...?

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
Why's Shinji sleeping beside me ?

59
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,890
Where am I ?
The hospital where my sister is...?

60
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,400
Oh, Shinji and Ayanami...

61
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,730
Why did you do that, Ikari ?

62
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,810
I couldn't forgive my father...

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,700
...he betrayed me.

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,900
I was happy to talk to
him after so much trouble.

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,770
He doesn't understand
how I feel.

66
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,600
Did you try to
understand him ?

67
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,790
I tried.

68
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,520
Why don't you try
to understand him ?

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,090
I tried to understand !

70
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,890
You're running away
from difficulties.

71
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,340
What's wrong...?

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,600
What's wrong with running
away from difficulties ?!

73
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,500
Why're they arguing ?

74
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,810
Your visit is an exception,
so you only have five minutes.

75
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,320
Sure.
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,480
Oh, Class Rep...

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,870
Suzuhara, are you alright ?

78
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,270
Yeah.
I guess I'm alive.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,540
I thought Shinji was there,
but I guess it was a dream.

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,660
He left the hospital yesterday.
You've been sleeping for three days.

81
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,450
I see.
For three days...

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,900
Why're you...

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,930
I came here as class
representative, nothing else.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Yeah, I know.

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
No, you don't.

86
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,700
I'm sorry...that your lunch.

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,560
It's okay. I feel sorry that
you can't eat lunch here.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Class Rep...

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,540
What ?

90
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,890
Can I ask
you a favor ?

91
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,090
Yes.

92
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,050
Tell my sister
that I'm alright.

93
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,750
Okay.

94
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,100
Come on, Ikari Shinji.
The Commander wants to see you.

95
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:14,400
Disobedience, selfish possession of Eva and threats. These are all crimes.

96
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,340
Do you have
anything to say ?

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes. I don't want to pilot Eva,
and I don't want to stay here either.

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,380
Then, leave.

99
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,860
Sure, I'll go back
to the teacher's place.

100
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,400
Are you going
to run away again ?

101
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,900
You disappoint me.
We won't meet again.

102
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,910
Sure, that's what I want.

103
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,900
It's me. Delete everything
about the Third Child.

104
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,250
Use the dummy plug for Unit 01
by converting to Rei's basics.

105
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,500
Shinji, is it true
that you're leaving ?

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,460
It's true, isn't it ?
But why ?

107
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,900
Why're you running away ?

108
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,800
I was envious because you were
different from me and the others.

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,230
Damn, even Touji
can pilot Eva, but I...

110
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,100
This phone's being monitored.
The call was cut off to maintain security.

111
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,830
Thank you for
your cooperation.

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
Asuka must've been so
disgusted that she wouldn't come.

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
Right. She didn't even
send her regards.

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,500
Just like her,
I'm satisfied.

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,020
If you keep trying to act like
that you'll have a hard time.

116
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,170
That's your style of living.
I can't do that.

117
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,400
I think you know, but your actions will be restricted from now on, alright ?

118
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,210
I know.

119
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,010
Umm...

120
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,980
What ?

121
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,340
Tell me one thing.

122
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,430
Why did the Fourth Child
have to be Touji ?

123
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,970
All of your classmates
were the fourth candidate.

124
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,620
I came to know that very recently.
Everything was already prepared.

125
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,540
Everyone...everyone in the class...?

126
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,290
We can't make amends for the incident with Suzuhara no matter how much we apologize.

127
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,850
But, Shinji, honestly speaking, I overlaid my dreams, hopes and purposes on yours.

128
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,840
I know I was imposing
on you with that.

129
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,900
But we...the people of NERV,
had to entrust our future to you.

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,260
Keep that
in mind, okay ?

131
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,480
It's so selfish, isn't it ?

132
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,900
I know that.

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll keep your pass code
to HQ and your room.

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,900
Don't waste your time.
You can get rid of them.

135
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,240
I'll never pilot Eva.

136
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,700
He's speaking so spontaneously.
It's never happened before.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,610
A state of emergency has
been issued for the Tokai area.

138
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,970
Area residents, please go to
designated shelters immediately.

139
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,250
I repeat...

140
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,900
An Angel.

141
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,100
NEON GENESIS

142
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,210
All personnel, first class battle stations.
Prepare for surface to air combat.

143
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,030
What about the target ?

144
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,510
Still advancing. It's broken through the defensive line at Komagatake.

145
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,240
First through eighteenth
layers are damaged.

146
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,100
Eighteen special armor
plates were so easily...

147
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,150
We won't be able to send
Eva to the surface in time !

148
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,790
Position Unit 02 inside
the Geo-Front to protect HQ !

149
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,310
Have Asuka attack the target as soon as it enters the Geo-Front.

150
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,690
What about Unit 00 ?

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,620
It's stationed at the
AT-Field neutralizing zone.

152
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,750
The left arm
hasn't been restored.

153
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,100
Incapable of combat...?

154
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Send Rei in Unit 01.

155
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,970
Prepare the dummy
plug for back-up.

156
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,600
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Start entry.

158
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,150
LCL, charged.

159
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,420
Start connecting the
A10 nerve circuit.

160
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,580
It won't work any more.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,170
The pulse is
flowing in reverse.

162
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,650
Unit 01's rejecting
the nerve connection.

163
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,650
No, it shouldn't be...

164
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,650
Ikari...

165
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,200
Yeah. It's going
to reject me.

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Stop activation.
Send Rei in Unit 00.

167
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,630
Reactivate Unit 01
with the dummy plug.

168
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,970
But Unit 00...

169
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,600
It's alright. I'll go.

170
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,900
Even if I die,
substitutes are available.

171
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,750
I've decided not
to pilot again.

172
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,440
Hey, what're you doing ?
Go to the shelter now.

173
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,700
It's no good !~~One more hit will break through all armor plating !

174
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

175
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,900
Here you come.

176
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,720
I can handle this easily
without Shinji around.

177
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,840
Damn you.

178
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,700
Next.

179
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,640
The AT-Field was supposed
to be neutralized...

180
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,060
Why can't I destroy it ?!

181
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,450
I can't lose again !

182
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
No way !

183
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,850
Damn you !

184
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,210
Asuka ! Cut all
nerve connections, quickly !

185
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,080
Evacuation drill...?
Are you stupid ?

186
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,670
It's got nothing
to do with us pilots.

187
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,740
It's landed on
the sixth shelter.

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,340
Abandon the sixth shelter. Those who survived, get to the third shelter.

189
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,640
Unit 02, severely damaged !
Disabled !

190
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,330
What about Asuka ?

191
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,780
She's alright.
She's alive.

192
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,530
Damn.

193
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,780
The Angel has
started to move.

194
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,000
What about Unit 01 ?

195
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,410
Dummy plug's been inserted.

196
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,160
Pulse induced.

197
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,410
Start connecting.

198
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay.

199
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,940
What ?

200
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,200
The pulse faded out !
It rejected the dummy plug !

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,180
It's no use, we're unable
to activate Unit 01 !

202
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,300
The dummy...and Rei...

203
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,250
It's not accepting.

204
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,830
Fuyutsuki...

205
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,280
...take charge for a moment.

206
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,650
Carry the injured
to the sixth block !

207
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,250
Have the survivors get
to the third shelter !

208
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,200
This way !

209
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,010
Hurry !

210
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,380
Hurry up !~~Move it !

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,820
What're you doing ?!
Do you want to die ?!

212
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,750
Asuka...

213
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,170
Oh, it's you, Shinji.

214
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,100
Kaji...

215
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,070
What're you doing here ?

216
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,570
That's my line.
What are you doing, Shinji ?

217
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:17,790
I...I won't pilot Eva.
I've made up my mind.

218
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,520
I see.

219
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,100
My part time job was brought to light,
so I don't have anything to do during battle.

220
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
I've been watering ever since.

221
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,650
At a time like this ?

222
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,720
Because of a
time like this...

223
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,590
Katsuragi's breasts may be comfortable,
but I want to be here when I die.

224
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,600
Die...

225
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,200
Yes, if the Angel makes contact with Adam being kept underneath...

226
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,240
...everybody'll be killed
because of the Third Impact.

227
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,570
Only Evangelion, which has power equal to the Angels, can prevent it.

228
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,020
Ayanami...without even
a rifle...?!

229
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,700
Is she going
to self-destruct...?

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,530
Rei !

231
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,710
The AT-Field, maximum.

232
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,610
What about Unit 00 ?

233
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,380
Rei !

234
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,540
Why did she...?

235
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:40,880
Shinji, all I can do is spray water. But you have something you, and only you, can do.

236
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,630
No one will force you,
so decide for yourself...

237
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,910
...what you should do now...

238
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,930
...so that you
won't regret it.

239
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,570
Direct hit on
the third basement !

240
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,500
Last armor melted !

241
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,580
Oh, no !~~The main shaft
was fully exposed !

242
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,210
Isn't Unit 01 active yet ?!

243
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,580
It refused the dummy plug !

244
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,400
It's no good,
there's no response !

245
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Continue.
Repeat from 108.

246
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,440
Let me pilot it !

247
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,500
Let me...let me...

248
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,890
Let me pilot Unit 01 !

249
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,620
Father...

250
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,790
Why are you still here ?

251
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,350
I'm...I'm the pilot
of Evangelion Unit 01...

252
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,580
...Ikari Shinji !

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,840
The target's entered the main shaft,
and it's descending !

254
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,520
Its destination...?

255
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,910
It's heading for
Central Dogma !

256
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,360
It's coming here !
All personnel, evacuate immediately !

257
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,320
All personnel, evacuate !
I repeat. All personnel...

258
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,710
Eva Unit 01...!

259
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,470
Shinji...?!

260
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,080
Misato !

261
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,200
Launch No.5, now !

262
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,800
Energy's out.

263
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,560
Unit 01's reached its activation limit !
Back-up's not working either !

264
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,470
Shinji...

265
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,670
Shinji !

266
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,000
Move, move, move, move...
please, move !

267
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,660
If you don't move now,
everything'll be over !

268
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,290
That's...

269
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,900
Move, move, move !

270
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Move, move, move,
move, move, move !

271
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,600
Move, move,
move, damn it !

272
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
If you don't move now...
If I can't do it now, everyone'll die !

273
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,910
I can't stand it !
So, please move !

274
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,180
E...Eva reactivated.

275
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,540
Incredible...

276
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,600
It can't be.
I can't believe this...

277
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,850
Unit 01's synchro ratio
is exceeding 400 percent.

278
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,500
She's awakened after all.

279
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,020
It's eating the Angel...

280
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,650
Is Eva Unit 01 trying to take
the S2 organ into itself...?

281
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,210
The binders...

282
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,410
Binders...?

283
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:35,340
Yes. That's not armor. Those are the binders to suppress Eva's innate power.

284
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,520
And it's shedding the binders itself.
No one can stop Eva any more.

285
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,250
The awakening and
liberation of Unit 01...

286
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,920
...SEELE won't remain silent.

287
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,370
Is this a part of your scenario,
Commander Ikari ?

288
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
It's begun.

289
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,360
Yeah.
Now, everything begins.

Mankind has been saved by the Eva's awakening,

298
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,180
but its pilot has been physically fused with the Eva.

299
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Shinji's been fused with another existence. What will he see?
