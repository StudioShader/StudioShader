1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,000
Like a cruel angel...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...young boy, become a legend.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,400
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,500
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,300
Lost while searching for something soft...

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,700
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,100
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,200
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:13,400
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,800
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

12
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,200
Neon Genesis

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,090
The reason to exist, La raison d'être

14
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,760
The reason to be allowed to be here.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,480
Ikari Shinji. In his case,

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,000
The boy wished to die.

17
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,620
The other boy accepted the wish.

18
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,490
The Final Angel disappeared.

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,780
Yet, Ikari Shinji is anguished.

20
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,300
Why did you kill him?

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,880
Why did you kill him?

22
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,880
Why did you kill him?

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,850
Why did you kill him?

24
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,960
Why did you kill him?

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,590
There was no other choice!

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,960
Why did you kill him?

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,930
Because Kaoru-kun was... He was an Angel!

28
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,200
Although he is a human as well?

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,990
No! Angel!

30
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,360
He was our enemy!

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,610
Although he was a human as well?

32
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,510
NO! NO! I SAY NO!

33
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,470
He was a human, like me.

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,760
NO!

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
He was an Angel.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,340
So you killed him?

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,820
THAT'S RIGHT!

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,860
Otherwise, we would have been killed.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,630
Everybody would have been killed.

40
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,990
So you killed him?

41
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,400
I did not want to kill him.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,580
Yet, there was no other choice!

43
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,600
So you killed.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,030
Help!

45
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,080
So you killed.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,270
Help!

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,270
So you killed.

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,240
Help!

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,090
So you killed.

50
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,090
Somebody help me!

51
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,250
So you killed.

52
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,710
Help! Is there anybody! Somebody help me!

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,490
Yes. It's Kaoru-kun that should have survived.

54
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,220
He was much better than I am.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,930
He should have survived.

56
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,990
No.

57
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,860
A surviver must have the will to survive.

58
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,020
He wished to die.

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,620
He abandoned the will to live, and depended on the false hope.

60
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,140
You are not wrong.

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,430
Is that really so?

62
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,170
Anxiety

63
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,370
Was that what I wished?

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,050
Obsession

65
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,710
I can't figure it out.

66
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,040
What shall I do?

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,370
What Shall I DO!

68
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,580
What do you fear?

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,490
What?

70
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,510
What do you fear?

71
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,520
Me.

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,470
What do you fear?

73
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,580
To be disliked.

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,600
What do you fear?

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,310
By whom?

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,900
What do you fear?

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,470
Who?

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,140
What do you fear?

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,680
That's my father!

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,170
He deserted me!

81
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,580
I was disliked.

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,660
What shall I do if I am disliked?

83
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,520
What shall I do?

84
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,760
Where am I?

85
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,590
Where shall I go?

86
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,180
Nothing visible.

87
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,180
Nothing intelligible.

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,530
Misato-san?

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,510
Misato-san!

90
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,220
Hey, where are you?

91
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,920
Hey, where shall I go from now on?

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,060
Misato-san!

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,840
Asuka!

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,690
Ayanami!

95
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,490
Touji!

96
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,100
Kensuke!

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,260
Ritsuko-san!

98
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,070
Kaji-san!

99
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,660
Father!

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,690
Mother!

101
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,270
Tell me,

102
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,570
What I should do!

103
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,650
Evangelion Unit One.

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,250
I have to pilot this, after all,

105
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,930
killing the one that I loved,

106
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,160
obeying the words from my father and others.

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
You say I must fight in this?

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,590
Mom! Say something! Answer me!

109
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,010
Why pilot Eva?

110
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,210
Because People ask me to pilot.

111
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,390
So you pilot?

112
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,330
Isn't it OK? It's for the sake of everybody! Isn't it OK?

113
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,760
You pilot Eva for the sake of others?

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,870
Yes!

115
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,650
That is a good thing.

116
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,610
That is a very good thing.

117
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,250
Everyone praises me, then.

118
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,500
That's a lie.

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,150
You idiot.

120
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,330
After all, it's for your own sake.

121
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,300
Eh?

122
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,840
And you excuse yourself as always.

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,290
Do I?

124
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,590
To think that you are doing your best for the sake

125
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,500
of others is an easy way to live.

126
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,170
Is that so?

127
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,390
In other words, you are lonely, Shinji.

128
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,980
Is that so?

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,120
That's nothing but a dependent or symbiotic relationship.

130
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,070
That might be.

131
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,840
All you wish is that people depend on you.

132
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,170
That might be.

133
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,970
All you do is waiting for someone to give you happiness.

134
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,950
A false happiness.

135
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,140
That's the very thing you do.

136
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,160
Soryuu Asuka Langley.

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,310
In her case,

138
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,470
I'm in Eva without my intention.

139
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,110
I'm forced to be in this.

140
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,580
This junk won't move!

141
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Oh, no, it's me that is junk.

142
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,920
Useless, that's me.

143
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,590
No one needs me.

144
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,020
No one needs a pilot who cannot control an Eva.

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,940
You are trying to find yourself within others.

146
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,840
Shut up!

147
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,950
Anxiety of separation.

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,240
You fear being alone.

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,180
Anxiety of separation.

150
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,900
You fear because you'd be erased together with others.

151
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,690
Anxiety of separation.

152
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,530
So you pilot.

153
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,370
Affection behavior.

154
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,390
Shut up!

155
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,210
Affection behavior.

156
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,770
Shut up! Shut up!

157
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,410
I don't wanna be told that by a doll like you!

158
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,720
The third character

159
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,140
Ayanami Rei, in her case,

160
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,310
Who am I?

161
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,800
Ayanami Rei.

162
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,540
Who are you?

163
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,120
Ayanami Rei

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
You are also Ayanami Rei?

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Yes. The thing called Ayanami Rei.

166
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,170
All these are the things called Ayanami Rei.

167
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,730
Why all of these are me?

168
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,430
Because others call us Ayanami Rei.

169
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,700
Why do you have a false mind and a false body?

170
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,470
Not false, for I am I.

171
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,730
No. You are a human whose false soul was made

172
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,950
by a man named Ikari Gendou.

173
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,960
You are a false object which is pretending to be a human.

174
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,460
Look, you have a dark, invisible, and unintelligible mind within you,

175
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,400
...where the true you exists.

176
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,110
I am I.

177
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,180
I've become me in the instrumentality of the

178
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,070
links between me and others.

179
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,600
I've been formed by the intercouse with others.

180
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,010
The intercouse with people and the flow of time

181
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,570
changed the shape of my mind.

182
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,900
Those are bonds?

183
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,330
Yes. Those have formed me so far, the thing called Ayanami Rei.

184
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,680
And, those will form me from now on.

185
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,110
Those are bonds?

186
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,790
But, there's someone else who is the true you.

187
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,390
You don't know her.

188
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,750
Because you don't want to see that. You are trying to run away.

189
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,970
Because of fear.

190
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,140
Because she might not have a human shape.

191
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,640
Because the present me might disappear.

192
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,640
fear

193
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,220
One fears that the Self could disappear.

194
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,330
Fear?

195
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,790
Doesn't make sense.

196
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,480
The world of the Self will disappear.

197
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,510
Are you not afraid?

198
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,390
The Self will disappear.

199
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,520
Are you not afraid?

200
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,750
No, I'm glad.

201
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,200
I am a thing that wishes to die.

202
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,430
All I need is to disappear.

203
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,280
I want to be a nothingness.

204
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,410
You can't be a nothingness.

205
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,940
That person won't let you be a nothingness.

206
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,470
Still not allowed to return.

207
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,180
I've existed because he needed me.

208
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,000
But, it's the end.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
Useless, will I be.

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,930
Deserted by him, will I be.

211
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:37,190
I've hoped for that day, although I fear it now.

212
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,970
Let's go.

213
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,000
You've existed for the sake of today, this day, Rei.

214
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,510
Yes.

215
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,500
And...

216
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,450
The complementation by the
instrumentality of man begins.

217
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,610
Shinji Again.

218
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,970
What feeling is this?

219
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,390
That is what I feel like I experienced before.

220
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,260
My body seems like disappearing.

221
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,730
Agreeable.

222
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,540
I feel like spreading, and becoming large,

223
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,470
to here, there and everywhere.

224
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,320
That was the very beginning
of the complementation of the people by the instrumentality of man.

225
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,580
Things people lost.

226
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,570
The lost minds.

227
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,120
Complementing the void in the mind.

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
The complementation
by the instrumentality of minds and soul begins.

229
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,410
All things return to nothingness.

230
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,500
The complementation
by the instrumentality of man
has just begun.

231
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,540
No,

232
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,660
It's not that everything returns to nothingness.

233
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,980
It's returning everything to the beginning.

234
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,230
Nothing but returning things to the mother

235
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,100
which has long since been lost.

236
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,200
All the minds become one, obtaining peace forever.

237
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,300
Nothing but that.

238
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,190
Is that the instrumentality of man project?

239
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,000
Right.

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,770
We always have an emptiness, something lost in our minds.

241
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,920
It yields the starvation within our minds.

242
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,530
It yields anxiety and fear within our minds.

243
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,900
Everybody fears darkness within his mind,

244
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,640
which one tries to escape from, tries to erase.

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
That's how people live.

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
But, nobody can ever escape from that.

247
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,220
So you unify people's minds and

248
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,820
make them complement each other?

249
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,960
How dare you presume to make the entirety of human existence into an experiment to prove your theory?!

250
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,060
And to use deception in order to accomplish it?!

251
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,010
Yet, you are the one who's wished for that.

252
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,900
Really?

253
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,900
Where am I?

254
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,540
In the case of Katsuragi Misato

255
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,670
This is the Me within your mind.

256
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,020
At the same time, it's my mind within you, isn't it?

257
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,760
In order for me to find me, I have to feel many kinds of people.

258
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,510
I have to gaze inside of me.

259
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
I have to gaze into the Misato-san within me.

260
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,230
What do you hope?

261
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,810
You want to be a good child.

262
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,240
Must I be a good child?

263
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,390
Why?

264
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,090
Since I don't have a daddy

265
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,780
Since I have to help mom, I must be a good child?

266
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,210
But, I don't want to be like you, mom.

267
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,830
When daddy is absent, mom is always crying.

268
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,900
Don't cry!

269
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,060
Don't depend!

270
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,230
So I must be a good child?

271
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,580
So that my daddy won't dislike me?

272
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,650
But I hate my father.

273
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,800
And I hated being a good child.

274
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,570
I hated it!

275
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,370
I'm tired of

276
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,950
keeping myself pure.

277
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,740
Keeping myself pretending to be pure.

278
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,820
I'm tired.

279
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,820
I wish to dirty myself.

280
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,440
I wished to see the Me dirty.

281
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,360
So you let him hold you?

282
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
So you let that guy hold you?

283
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,510
NO!

284
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,160
I let him do it, because I loved him.

285
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
You truly loved him?

286
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
Obviously!

287
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,070
He accepted what I truly was.

288
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,840
Really?

289
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,500
He was tender.

290
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,950
NO!

291
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,610
Don't show this to Shinji-kun!

292
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,460
You don't have to be ashamed of that moment.

293
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,120
I am ashamed of it.

294
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,950
Why feel shame?

295
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,090
You can show it to the guy you love.

296
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,160
Moreover, you wish to show this.

297
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,470
NO! Stop!

298
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,940
You must be glad to show this to Shinji.

299
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,680
NO!

300
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,400
NO! NO WAY!

301
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,980
I wonder.

302
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,620
It's to your father that you wan to show this.

303
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,890
NO!

304
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,530
You tried to find peace in Kaji-kun's arms.

305
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,620
NO!

306
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,800
You tried to find a peace in Kaji-kun's kindness.

307
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,820
NO!

308
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,670
You tried to find your father in Kaji-kun's arms.

309
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,970
NO!

310
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,340
YES.

311
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,950
I found the father within Kaji-kun back then.

312
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,260
So I fled from him.

313
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,390
I feared.

314
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,790
He was just like my father.

315
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,760
But, it was because I was happy,

316
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
It was a joy.

317
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,900
It was truly an enjoyable joy!

318
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,910
So I did hate.

319
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,850
So I did separate.

320
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,770
No reason to begin love, but a reason to end the love.

321
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,250
You are so kind..

322
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:33,750
You are so kind.. So I beg you, disgrace me.

323
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,140
Don't hurt yourself only because you hate yourself now.

324
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,050
Punishing yourself is only a trick to make you feel better for a little while.

325
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,280
Don't do that.

326
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,710
Andnow you're going to say, "you must take care of yourself"?

327
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,410
Guys always do so.

328
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,820
And Guys work, and Guys go into their world, leaving me behind.

329
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,280
Just like my father.

330
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
Always trying to escape from the hardships in reality.

331
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,000
Hardship in reality?

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,310
It's me?

333
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,700
It's me. Yes. It's me.

334
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,600
It's inevitable.

335
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Stop, Misato-san.

336
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,350
I despise myself.

337
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,890
I hate myself!

338
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,850
You're vulgar and impure.

339
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,990
Pathetic!

340
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,300
Disgusting! You're a dirty whore!

341
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,470
Is that the adults' intercourse?
I really hate that!

342
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,340
Congratulations with you promotion. Major Katsuragi.

343
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,230
The Me who is recognized is the Me who is performing

344
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,680
a role in order to be appreciated.

345
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,650
It's not the true Me.

346
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
The true Me is always crying.

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,790
Yes. I am happy!

348
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,520
Am I happy?

349
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,630
I am happy.

350
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,740
Am I happy?

351
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,880
I am happy....?

352
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Am I happy?

353
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,930
NO!

354
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,590
This is not happiness!

355
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,620
What's happiness?

356
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,030
This is not the true Me!

357
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,300
I am only trying to think so.

358
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,940
Otherwise, we cannot live?

359
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,480
We are unstable unless we are together.

360
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,560
Unstable.

361
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,790
Unless someone is in the same bed.

362
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,720
You are afraid to sleep alone?

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,830
You are tired of sleeping alone?

364
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,650
Or does sleeping alone remind you of how empty your life is?

365
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,030
Then, Anybody will do.

366
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,660
NO!

367
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,980
YES, you wish to get some simple joy.

368
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,420
You are trying to cure your mind with temporary escape.

369
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,020
You are making use of GUYS.

370
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,730
NO NO NO WAY!

371
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,260
What does she really wish?

372
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,860
Where am I?

373
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,330
It's my mind within Asuka's.

374
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,940
Then, it's my mind within Shinji.

375
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,920
In the case of Soryuu Asuka Langley.

376
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,300
What do you hope?

377
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,200
I can live alone.

378
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,060
I don't need either daddy or mom.

379
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,370
I live alone.

380
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,040
I won't cry anymore.

381
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,310
Yet, I am crying.

382
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,800
Why am I crying?

383
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,380
It's difficult for me to deal with that child.

384
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,970
That's not like you, a doctor.

385
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,710
A Doctor is a human being,

386
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,560
as I said before.

387
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,450
Still, you're a traind professional, how can you...

388
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,080
She acts too much like an adult, and rejects me completely.

389
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,120
Sometimes she scares me.

390
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,820
Haven't you had that feeling with her?

391
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,210
Well,

392
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,860
Anyhow, you are Asuka's mother, after all.

393
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,620
I became your wife before that.

394
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,200
Aren't you both?

395
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,950
From a social persective, yes.

396
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,140
However, I can quit being her mother at anytime.

397
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,150
...but you cannot quit being her father.

398
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,450
Well, you could say that.

399
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,390
NO! STOP!

400
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,490
Don't quit being my mother!

401
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,260
I'll be a good child!

402
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,470
So, don't quit being my mother.

403
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,400
So, look at me!

404
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
Stop MOM, don't kill me!

405
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Your daddy hates your mommy.

406
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,130
Your daddy deserted me.

407
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,570
No, he never loved me to begin with.

408
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,600
He didn't need me at all.

409
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,520
So, let's die together with mom.

410
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,130
Daddy does not need us.

411
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,520
Am I a waste?

412
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,800
Am I useless?

413
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,820
Let's die together.

414
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,740
NO!

415
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,060
I'm not your doll.

416
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,980
I can think by myself, I can live by myself.

417
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,510
Then, my mommy was hanging from the cealing.

418
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,930
She looked so happy.

419
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,610
But I hated her face back then.

420
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,760
I don't wanna die.

421
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,290
I don't wanna let myself disappear.

422
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,960
I don't like boys.

423
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,180
I don't like daddy, mom.

424
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,060
I don't like anybody!

425
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,700
Nobody protects me.

426
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,780
Nobody is by me.

427
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,330
What does she wish?

428
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,920
So, I do live alone.

429
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,930
But I don't want that.

430
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,660
It's painful.

431
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,950
I don't wanna be alone.

432
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,080
I don't wanna be alone.

433
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,640
I don't wanna be alone!

434
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't leave me.

435
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,400
Don't desert me.

436
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,180
Don't kill me.

437
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,130
What's this?

438
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,360
This is the Instrumentality of Man project that

439
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,980
your father has been carrying out.

440
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,520
This is it?

441
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,170
This is part of it, I think.

442
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,230
The truth is yet unknown to us.

443
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,130
The things you perceive constitute the truth.

444
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,280
Things within you.

445
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,860
And the things recorded in your memory will be your truth.

446
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,100
There is a truth that changes through time.

447
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,340
This is the truth.

448
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,140
The result of everything, is this?

449
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,170
Out of many truths, one is this.

450
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,010
That's the result you wished.

451
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,670
I wished?

452
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,750
Yes.

453
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,240
The destruction, the world, where nobody would be saved.

454
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,280
NO. It's that nobody saved me.

455
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,500
Nobody can save you.

456
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,200
This is what you wished for.

457
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,910
The destruction, the death, the return to nothingness.

458
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,630
All of these, you did wish.

459
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,550
This is the reality.

460
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,520
What's the reality?

461
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,460
Your world.

462
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,190
With time, with space, with other people, the world of your own.

463
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,100
The world where how to accept things and how to perceive things

464
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,030
are absolutely up to you.

465
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,500
It's the world where you just wait for others to give you something.

466
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,860
That is reality.

467
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,880
This is your world no matter what.

468
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,070
It's the the world where everything is already set isn't it?

469
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,890
No, it's the world that you are setting.

470
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,230
The world where your mind decides what will be.

471
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,280
That's the reality.

472
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
Whether it's the will to live.

473
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,360
or the wish to die, that is up to you.

474
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,330
Are you saying that this darkness, this insane world...

475
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,640
are what I wished?

476
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,650
Yes.

477
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,220
A closed world where nobody but you is comfortable.

478
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,700
That is the very world you wished for.

479
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,720
To protect your weak mind.

480
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,350
To protect your joy.

481
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,780
This is the result.

482
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,130
In a closed space with nobody but you in it,

483
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,430
others cannot live.

484
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,590
But you wished the world to close on yourself.

485
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,260
Excluding what you hate, you wished a world of solitude.

486
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,560
That's the world you created, a private haven in the recesses of your mind.

487
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,000
This is one of the possible conclusions.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,800
A fate which you chose.

489
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,670
Instrumentality continues...

A conclusion, that must follow a beginning.

495
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,390
Our hope will be lead to a destruction?

496
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,580
Our hope will be the very death?
