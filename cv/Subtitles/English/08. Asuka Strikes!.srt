SHIN SEIKI

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Yes, I've already made arrangements with the Committee about that problem.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,200
The cargo left Sasebo yesterday, and is now in the Pacific.

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Mil-55D transport helicopter !
I never thought I'd get a chance to be on one !

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,000
It's great to have friends,
isn't it, Shinji ?

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,300
I thought it was stuffy staying in the mountain every day, so I invited all of you on my date.

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Then, is this a real
date with Misato ?

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,200
I bought this cap
just for today, Misato.

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,900
So, where are we going ?

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,500
We're going to be cruising the
Pacific on some gorgeous ships !

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Five carriers and
four battleships !

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
It's a large fleet.
It's definitely good to have friends.

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,900
That's ``gorgeous ?''

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,700
You bet it's gorgeous !

29
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,800
That's the carrier, ``Over the Rainbow,''
the pride of the U.N. Forces.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,100
It's huge.

31
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,100
I wonder how such an
obsolete ship can stay afloat.

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,500
No, no, it's
pre-Second Impact vintage.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,100
How nice,
they brought a toy socket.

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,500
They're on an
errand for the kid.

35
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,600
Great...

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,100
...great...

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,800
...great...

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,300
...great...

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,900
...great...

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,700
...great...

41
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,200
...great...

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,300
Too great ! If you're a man,
you weep at such a sight !

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Great...!

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,800
...great...

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,400
...great...

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,000
...great...

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,700
...great...

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
Hey, wait ! Wait !

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,300
Damn it !
Stop ! Stop !

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Hello, Misato.
How've you been ?

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
As well as ever.
You look taller.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah ! And the rest of
my body has grown too.

53
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,400
Let me introduce you...

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,800
She's the exclusive pilot of Evangelion Unit 02,
the Second Child, Souryu Asuka Langley.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Episode 8

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Asuka

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Arrives at Japan

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,300
What'd you hit me for ?!

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Payment for the view.
Cheap, wasn't it ?

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,500
Say what ?
Then I'll show you mine, too.

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,900
What're you doing ?!

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
So, which is the
much-discussed Third Child ?

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Don't tell me it's...

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
No, he's the one.

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
He seems rather dull...

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:29,100
I thought you were accompanying kids from the Boy Scouts, but it seems that I was wrong.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,800
Thank you for your
understanding, Captain.

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Don't mention it. I'm rather happy to have kids to take care of after such a long time.

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,900
We appreciate your assistance with the transport of Eva Unit 02.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
Here's the specifications
for the emergency power socket.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I haven't heard any requests to mobilize ``that'' doll at sea.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,800
Just think of it as
back-up in case of emergency.

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,100
To guard against such emergencies,
we, the Pacific Fleet, are escorting it.

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,400
When did the U.N.
become a delivery service ?

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,900
I believe it was just after a certain organization was established.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
This is a massive escort
for guarding a mere toy.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,800
The entire
Pacific Fleet is mobilized.

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Considering Eva's importance,
it seems too small.

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Well, please sign these forms.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Not yet.

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
At the request of the
3rd Branch in Germany...

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,400
...both Unit 02 and its pilot are under this fleet's command.

83
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
I won't allow you
to just do as you please !

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Then, when will
you transfer command ?

85
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
After unloading the
cargo at Shin-Yokosuka.

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,100
We're still in charge at sea.
Follow our orders without question.

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,000
I understand. In an emergency, however,
please don't forget that Nerv has authority.

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,100
She's cool !

89
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,600
She's almost like Ritsuko...

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
You're as
courteous as ever...

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Kaji-senpai !

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,800
Hi.

93
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Kaji, I didn't invite
you to the bridge.

94
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Sorry about that.

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,500
Well, excuse us.
On the way to Shin-Yokosuka...

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,100
Is this a date ?

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,500
Awesome,
too awesome.

98
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
Shit ! Those kids
will save the Earth ?

99
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,800
Times change. I heard that Congress has put its hopes in that robot.

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,200
In that toy ? Idiots !

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,700
If they have the money for things like that, they should be paying US more !

102
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,300
What're you doing here ?!

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm accompanying her.
I'm on a business trip from Germany.

104
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,300
I was careless... I should have expected this to happen...

105
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,300
Hey, don't touch me !

106
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Hey, don't touch me !

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,800
What can we do ?!

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,000
The 3rd Squadron has
taken off as scheduled...

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Are you seeing anyone ?

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
It's none of
your business, is it ?

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh, you're so cold.

112
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,100
You're living with
Katsuragi, aren't you ?

113
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,400
Y...yes.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,500
Tell me, does she still
toss about in her sleep ?

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Wh...wh...

116
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
What're you
talking about ?!

117
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,200
So, she hasn't changed,
has she, Ikari Shinji ?

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,500
N...no. How do
you know my name ?

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,700
It's no surprise, you're
famous in our society...

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,400
...the Third Child, who piloted
Eva in combat without any training.

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
Not really.
It was luck.

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,900
That luck is part of your destiny.
It's your talent.

123
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,300
See you later, then.

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,900
Okay.

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
This has to be a bad joke.
No, a nightmare...

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
What do you think
of Ikari Shinji ?

127
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,500
He's dull !~~I'm disappointed that a boy like him has been chosen as the Third Child.

128
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,100
When confronted by sudden combat,
his synchro-ratio exceeded 40%.

129
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,000
No way.

130
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,500
That captain was
completely arrogant !

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,300
He's a proud man.
He couldn't help saying some ironies.

132
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,600
He seems to be
rather lively...Kaji, I mean.

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
He's always been
like that. The idiot !

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Third Child !

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,900
Come with me.

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,700
I didn't know
Unit 02 was red.

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,200
That's not the
only difference.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,300
After all, Units 00 and 01 are prototypes.
They're just test models.

139
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,600
That's why it synchronized with someone who hasn't had any training.

140
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,900
However, Unit 02
is different.

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:43,000
This is a true Evangelion, the first on Earth to be built for actual combat. The final model.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,900
What's happening ?

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Shock wave in the water...!

144
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,000
Something's exploded nearby.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,800
That's....

146
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,600
Is that... an Angel ?

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,100
Is that a real one...?

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,700
What should I do ?
I have to get back to where Misato is.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Chance.

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
NEON GENESIS

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,100
All ships, check distance between ships and take evasive maneuvers.

152
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
Report the situation.

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
``Cinbli'' is sinking. ``Titus Andronicus'' hasn't confirmed the target.

154
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
Damn it !
What's going on ?!

155
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,500
Hello, Nerv service.

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,100
Do you need data and countermeasures against that invisible enemy ?

157
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,100
We're engaged in battle ! Unauthorized personnel are not allowed here !

158
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,000
From what I can tell,
this must be an Angel attack.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
All ships,
fire at will.

160
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
That's useless.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,700
That kind of attack
won't penetrate its AT-field.

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Why is the Angel here ?

163
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Is it for Unit 02 ?

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey, where're we going ?

165
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,100
Wait here a second !

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
What's she doing...?

167
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,800
Don't peep, you jerk !

168
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,300
Why are boys
such perverted idiots ?!

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,800
Asuka, let's go.

170
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
Why won't it sink ?

171
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
Only Eva can defeat it,
after all.

172
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Hey, let's go !

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,500
You're coming with me !

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,500
Hey, why're we
changing into plug suits ?

175
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,100
Are you stupid ? It's obvious.
We're gonna defeat it with Unit 02.

176
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
That's going too far.
Shouldn't we ask Misato ?

177
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,500
I'll ask after I win.

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,900
Here I go. I'll show
you how skillful I am.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Just don't disturb me.

180
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,100
Strange. It seems to be
looking for something.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I never expected an Angel attack here.
This isn't like what you said.

182
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,100
That's what Unit 02 is for,
and another pilot's there as a reserve.

183
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,900
If the worst happens,
escape by yourself.

184
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,200
I understand.

185
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,700
LCL Fullung, Anfang der Bewegung...

186
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,500
...Anfang des Nerven anschlusses...

187
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,800
...Ausloses von links-Kleidung...
Synchro-Start.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
Error ?
What happened ?

189
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Mental noise !
I told you not to disturb me !

190
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,100
What do you mean ?

191
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,900
You're thinking in Japanese, aren't you ? Think in German !

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,100
A...all right...
Ba...baumkuuhen...

193
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Idiot !

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, fine ! Switch base
thought language to Japanese.

195
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,800
Evangelion Unit 02, activate !

196
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,300
Message from ``Othello:''
Evangelion Unit 02 has activated.

197
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,800
What ?!

198
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,900
Nice, Asuka !

199
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,500
No, halt the activation sequence.
Put it back.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
I don't care !
Asuka, launch !

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
What !?

202
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Both Eva and its pilot are under our command.
I won't let you do as you like !

203
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,300
What're you talking about ?! Who cares about procedure at a time like this ?

204
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,600
Hey...!

205
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,100
Is she serious ? Unit 02's
still configured with B-equipment.

206
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
If we fall
into the sea, it's over.

207
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,800
If we don't,
we'll be okay.

208
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Shinji, you're also on board ?

209
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,300
Yes.

210
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,700
Two kids...

211
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Can I test it...?

212
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Asuka, go for it !

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,300
It's coming.

214
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,100
Here we go.

215
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,600
Which way ?

216
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,700
Over there.

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Only 58 seconds left.

218
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,800
I know ! Misato, prepare the emergency external power supply on deck !

219
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,900
I understand.

220
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,200
What are you
going to do ?

221
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
Okay, I'm gonna jump !

222
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Jump ?

223
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,400
Run !

224
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Spare socket ready.

225
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Reactor connection complete.

226
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,500
Clear the flight deck.

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,900
Eva, cleared to land.

228
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
All personnel,
prepare for impact.

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,300
Nonsense !

230
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,000
Eva Unit 02, landiiiiing !

231
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,500
What a waste !

232
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
Target is rapidly
approaching the ship !

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
It's coming
from 9 o'clock !

234
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,500
Switching to
external power source.

235
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Switching complete.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,300
But, we don't
have a gun.

237
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,900
One Prog'knife is enough.

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,900
That thing's really big.

239
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,200
That's what I thought.

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
What're they going to do ?

241
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Close range combat's the
best way to defeat Angels.

242
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,500
Alright, Asuka,
you stopped it !

243
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,400
This isn't a joke !
The flight deck's messed up...

244
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,000
It's fallen.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Asuka, underwater battle is
impossible with B-equipment.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,900
We won't know
until we try, right ?

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,800
What a waste...

248
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,700
What about the
length of the cable ?

249
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
One thousand
two hundred remaining.

250
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
What're you going to do ?

251
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
We can deal with it.

252
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,400
We have to do something.

253
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
The cable's running out.
Prepare for shock.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Damn !

255
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,500
Eva lost the target.

256
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
Change disks...

257
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,100
Yak-38bis !

258
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,500
Hey, Katsuragi !

259
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
Kaji !

260
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,000
I have something to deliver,
so I'm leaving now...

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,900
Go ahead.

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
So, if you'll excuse me,
Captain Katsuragi...

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
He ran away.

264
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Target approaching Eva again !

265
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
It's coming again !

266
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
I'll kill it this time !

267
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,900
What ?!
It's not working !

268
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,400
With B-equipment...

269
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,500
What can we do ?

270
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
What can we...?

271
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,500
How pathetic !
You're the Third Child, aren't you ?

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Here it comes !

273
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,600
Mouth ?

274
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,700
Because it's an Angel...

275
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,400
Eva Unit 02's
entered target's body.

276
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,300
Does that mean
Eva was eaten ?!

277
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,700
It's like fishing...

278
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,800
Fishing...?
Yes, fishing !

279
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,300
We're in trouble again.

280
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
Shut up...

281
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,300
Hey, get off me,
you pervert !

282
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
But we have
to free ourselves !

283
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,800
Asuka, can you hear me ?
Don't release it !

284
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,500
Captain.

285
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,700
What ?

286
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
I beg your cooperation.

287
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Point blank fire by the
two remaining battleships ?

288
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,800
Yes. We sink two unmanned battleships on the axial line of the umbilical cable to set a trap.

289
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,500
Meanwhile, Eva Unit 02 will
open the target's mouth.

290
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,800
The ships will then
rush into the opening.

291
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,600
After firing, self-destruct
them to destroy the target.

292
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
That's insane !

293
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,000
Insane, but
not impossible.

294
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
I understand.

295
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
All hands, abandon ship.
Repeat, all hands abandon ship.

296
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,500
All frigates, pick up those people in the lifeboats, quickly !

297
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,100
But what about Eva ?

298
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,400
Don't worry,
those two'll be alright.

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Hey, don't operate my Unit 02
without my permission !

300
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Do both of you
understand the operation ?

301
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll do my best.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm counting on you.

303
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,700
Open the Kingston valves.
Start sinking to Z-point.

304
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Roger.
Reverse the cable.

305
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,100
Eva has started surfacing.
70 to contact.

306
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,600
Hey, you're still
touching me. Move over !

307
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,700
But if we can't open the mouth soon, we'll also be destroyed.

308
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
60 to contact.

309
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Status of Angel's mouth ?

310
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,300
Still closed.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Both battleships are
sinking to the target.

312
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,700
Eva's surfacing !
50 to contact !

313
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
It's no use !

314
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
We don't have
much time left...

315
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,800
Target has passed
under the ``Tempest.''

316
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,300
Hurry or you'll
be too late !

317
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,700
Don't think strange things !

318
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Like what ?

319
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Never mind,
just concentrate.

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I know.

321
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,500
20 to contact.

322
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,900
15 to contact.

323
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
Open, open, open, open !

324
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Open, open, open, open !

325
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Fire !

326
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,800
Shin Yokosuka (Formerly Odawara)

327
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,200
You did it again.

328
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,000
I should have prepared
for underwater combat.

329
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,100
How rare.
Second-guessing yourself ?

330
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,600
Don't say it.
We've obtained precious data.

331
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
You're right.

332
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
Misato...

333
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,100
It's truly precious.

334
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,800
P...pair-look !

335
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
That's sick !

336
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,900
They set a new
synchro-ratio record, didn't they ?

337
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
For only 7 seconds.
It was probably because of the danger...

338
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,200
Hey, where's Kaji ?

339
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,800
He escaped earlier. He must've arrived at HQ ! That bastard !

340
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,700
Well, that was an
eventful journey.

341
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Was it because of this ?

342
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,100
It has already been
restored to this stage.

343
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,600
It's held within hard Bakelite,
though I'm certain it's still alive.

344
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,100
It's the key to the Complement of Humanity Project, isn't it ?

345
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,900
Yes. This is the
first human being...

346
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,800
...ADAM.

347
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,800
Really, she was a disgusting girl,
despite her lovely appearance.

348
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,700
Well, we'll never
see her again.

349
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,100
But, sir, you can't avoid meeting her because of your job. I really sympathize with you.

350
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm Souryu Asuka Langley.
