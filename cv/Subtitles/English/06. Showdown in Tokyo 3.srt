''kono sora wo daite kagayaku shoonen yo shinwa ni nare''

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,300
A powerful energy reaction
detected inside the target.

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
What ?!

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,600
Accelerating to its
outer rim and converging.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,300
Could it be...?!

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,100
No, get out
of the way !

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Recover it, quickly !

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,500
Target is silent.

23
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
What about Shinji ?

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,000
He's alive.

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Unit 01 recovered.
Move to 7th cage.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm going to the cage.
Take care of the rest.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,900
Unit 01 secured.

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Pilot's brainwaves unstable.

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Pulse very weak.

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Life support system full.
Begin heart massage.

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,100
Alright.

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,600
Pulse confirmed.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Eject the plug forcefully, hurry !

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,500
LCL emergency exhaust.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Roger.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
Hurry, open the hatch.
Quickly !

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,000
Shinji...

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Episode 6:
Decisive Battle
in Tokyo-3.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Scale: 1/1 Balloon Dummy

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
Struck by the enemy particle
accelerator cannon. Dummy evaporated.

41
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,800
Next.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Type-12 Automatic Cannon

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,300
Type-12 Automatic
Cannon destroyed.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
I see.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,600
According to the data
we've collected so far...

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,100
...it's presumed that the enemy automatically attacks any target inside a certain range.

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,100
100% of the targets inside that area have been destroyed by the particle cannon.

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Close range combat
with Eva is too risky.

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,100
What about its AT-field ?

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Still active. It's so strong that we can even see the phase-shifted space.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,100
Pathetic attacks like inductive cannons or bombing are a waste.

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Defense and offense almost perfect.
It's like a floating fortress.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
Then, what about
that troublesome probe ?

54
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,400
The target is directly above us, entering Tokyo-3 area Zero.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,100
A gigantic probe with a diameter of 17.5 meters is drilling into Nerv HQ, in the Geo-Front.

56
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,800
The enemy is going to attack Nerv HQ directly, I suppose.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,900
How corny.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,900
And what's the estimated
time of penetration ?

59
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,300
At six minutes fifty-four
seconds after midnight.

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
At that time, we estimate
it will reach the Nerv HQ...

61
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,200
...after breaking through
all 22 defense barriers.

62
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,400
Less than 10 hours left...

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Enemy probe has reached
the first defense barrier.

64
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,400
What's the condition
of Unit 01 ?

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Chest piece, third defense armor,
was heavily melted.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,100
It was fortunate that the
central control unit stayed intact.

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,300
Three more seconds,
and it'd have been ``out.''

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Replacement will be
completed in 3 hours.

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Roger.
What about Unit 00 ?

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,100
No problem with restarting, but errors are still detected in its feedback.

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
An actual battle is...

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,800
...still impossible...? What's the condition of Unit 01's pilot ?

73
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,200
No physical damage. Nerve pulse's are 0.8 higher than normal, but it's acceptable.

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
9 hours 55 minutes
to enemy penetration.

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,900
The situation
isn't so good.

76
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
Should we wave
a flag of truce ?

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,400
I have one tiny thing
to try before that.

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Long range direct fire from outside the target's range ?

79
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes. There's no other way but to break through one point...

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,200
...with the high energy condenser without neutralizing its AT-field.

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
What did Magi say ?

82
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,400
Super computer Magi's answer
is two for affirmative...

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,900
...one for affirmative,
with some conditions.

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,200
Chance of winning is 8.7%.

85
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,500
That's the highest value.

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,700
There's no reason to reject it.
Carry on, Captain Katsuragi.

87
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Aye, sir.

88
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,700
Anyway, you've planned an absurd operation, Miss Planning Manager Katsuragi.

89
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,500
``Absurd?'' You're so rude. It can be done in 9 hours, and it's the most effective plan.

90
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Is this...really ?

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Eva Special Positron Rifle
(Cyclotron prototype 20)

92
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,900
Our positron rifle won't be able to withstand that much power.

93
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
What are you
going to do ?

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,700
It's obvious. I'm going
to borrow another one.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
``Borrow ?''
You mean...

96
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
Yep. The SSDF(Strategic Self
Defense Force) Lab's prototype.

97
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,500
For those reasons,
Special Institute, Nerv...

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,400
...has the right to requistion this automatic positron cannon as of 15:00 today.

99
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
But, you know...
It's impossible.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,900
We'll do our best to return this in its original condition.

101
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,800
Well, thank you very
much for your cooperation.

102
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Okay Rei, take it out.

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,700
This is a delicate machine,
so handle with care.

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,600
But, the power to defeat an AT-field is at least 180 million kilowatts.

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,900
Where are you going
to find that much power ?

106
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,600
It's obvious.
From all over Japan.

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Sorry for interrupting the program,
but we have emergency news.

108
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,900
From 11:30 pm today, through early morning tomorrow, a large scale...

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,400
...blackout's planned for all of Japan. We thank you for your cooperation.

110
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,200
I repeat. From 11:30 pm today,
through early morning tomorrow...

111
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,300
...a large scale blackout's planned for all of Japan. We thank you for your cooperation.

112
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,600
Enemy probe has broken
through 7th defense barrier.

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
What's the status of the
energy supply system ?

114
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,100
3.2% delay from the plan at this moment, but we'll complete it by 23:10 today.

115
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
How's the positron rifle ?

116
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,400
For the honor of Tech Development Section 3, we'll build it in 3 hours.

117
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,900
What about the
defense method ?

118
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,400
Well, there's no other
way but to use a shield.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,300
Is this a shield ?

120
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes. It's a
hand-me-down from SSTO.

121
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,800
It doesn't look good, but the bottom part is super electromagnetically coated...

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,700
...so it should withstand that attack for 17 seconds. Section 2 guarantees that.

123
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,200
That's nice.
Where's the firing location ?

124
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,700
Considering the distance to the target, geographical features...

125
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,200
...and the power supply installation, this is the best location.

126
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,200
Looks good.

127
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay, the firing location
is the top of Mt. Futagoyama.

128
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,200
The operation starts
at 00:00.00 tonight.

129
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,800
This operation is
called ``Yashima Operation.''

130
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,100
Roger.

131
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
So, the pilots are
the final problem.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
The pilot of Unit 01's regained consciousness.
There's no problem in the checked values.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Okay, then proceed with
the operation as planned.

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Roger.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
Will he really
get into it again ?

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Proceed to the final battle
on Mt. Futagoyama. Hurry !

137
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,800
Ayanami...

138
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,800
I've come to inform you of the schedule for the Yashima Operation which starts at midnight.

139
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,600
Ikari and Ayanami, come to
the cage at 17:30 today.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,100
18:00, activate Unit 00
and Unit 01.

141
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,700
18:05, launch.

142
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,700
18:30, arrive at temporary base at Mt. Futagoyama, and wait for orders.

143
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,000
The operation
starts at midnight.

144
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Here's a new one.

145
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,600
Don't come looking like
``that'' because you're groggy.

146
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,300
Sorry.

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I've been saying that
a lot since yesterday.

148
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
Your meal.

149
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
I don't feel like eating.

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
We depart in one hour.

151
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Do I have to
get into it again?

152
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes, that's right.

153
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I don't want to. You can say that because you haven't had any awful experiences inside it.

154
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
I don't want to have that kind of experience again.

155
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Why don't you
stay in bed ?

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Stay in bed ?

157
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,600
I'll pilot Unit 01.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Dr. Akagi is ready to rewrite
the personal data of Unit 01.

159
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,500
Ritsuko is...?

160
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,200
Then, I'm going. Capt. Katsuragi
and Dr. Akagi are waiting for me.

161
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Goodbye.

162
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,800
NEON GENESIS

163
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm tired of waiting.
It's time to take shelter.

164
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,600
I peeked at my dad's data.
I'm sure about the time.

165
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
But they haven't shown up.

166
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,500
That mountain's moving.

167
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,200
It's Evangelion !

168
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,500
Awesome !

169
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,200
Good luck !
We all trust in you !

170
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,500
Enemy probe has broken through the 17th defense barrier.

171
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,600
3 hours 55 minutes
to arrival at HQ.

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
Electric power supply from Shikoku and Kyushu Areas complete.

173
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,700
Begin testing
each cooling system.

174
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
This's a delicate machine,
so handle with care.

175
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,900
This's only for a battlefield.
Will it really work ?

176
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
There's no other way.
It's an emergency.

177
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,300
Will it be alright ?

178
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
Theoretically, yes.

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,300
But I won't know if the barrel and accelerator can handle it until the first shot's fired.

180
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,500
We've never done any tests
with so much power.

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,100
I'll now announce each of
your positions in the operation.

182
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,900
Shinji.

183
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Yes.

184
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,500
You're the
gunner in Unit 01.

185
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Okay.

186
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,900
Rei, you're the
defense in Unit 00.

187
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,600
This is because Shinji's
synchronization ratio is higher.

189
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,000
This time,
we need precision.

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Since the positron is affected by the rotation, magnetic field...

191
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,400
...and gravity of Earth,
it does not go straight.

192
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't forget to adjust for that error.
You must hit the core precisely.

193
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,400
But, I've never practiced.

194
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,300
No problem.
Just do as the textbook says.

195
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,700
When the markers are aligned in the middle, pull the trigger.

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,400
The machine'll do
the rest automatically.

197
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,200
And it'll take a while for
the next shot because of...

198
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,700
...cooling, reloading,
and exchanging of the fuses.

199
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,400
Then, what if I miss, and the enemy starts shooting at us...?

200
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,300
Don't think about anything but hitting and destroying it with one shot.

201
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,000
We'd be in
big trouble, then.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,100
I...I'll have to
protect Unit 01, right ?

203
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,200
Yes.

204
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,200
I understand.

205
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,000
It's time.
Change your clothes.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay.

207
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,700
We may die.

208
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,300
Why do you say that ?

209
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,500
You won't die...

210
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,900
...because I will protect you.

211
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,900
Why do you pilot it ?

212
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Because of my ties.

213
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Ties ?

214
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Yes, ties.

215
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,200
With my father ?

216
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,900
With everyone.

217
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,600
You're strong, Ayanami.

218
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I have nothing else.

219
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,500
``Nothing else ?''

220
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,700
It's time. Let's go.

221
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,400
Goodbye.

222
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,200
We're approaching midnight.

223
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
Start the operation.

224
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Shinji, we entrust all the power of Japan to you. Do your best.

225
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,500
Okay.

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
Begin the first connection.

227
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,600
Sector 1 to 803,
start supplying power.

228
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,400
Voltage is coming up
to operational level.

229
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
All cooling systems,
full power.

230
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Temperature stable.
No problems.

231
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Positron charge, doing well.

232
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,500
Second connection.

233
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Start all accelerators.

234
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,700
Start compulsive condenser.

235
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,100
Direct all power to the substation on Mt. Futagoyama. Third connection. No problems.

236
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,400
Release all final
safety systems.

237
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,500
Pull the bolt back.

238
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,300
Adjust for the gravity and rotation of the Earth. Plus 0.0009.

239
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,800
0.2 to firing voltage.

240
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,300
7th and final connection.

241
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,400
All energy to
the positron rifle.

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
5...

243
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,800
High energy reaction
detected in the target !

244
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
What ?!

245
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
1.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,100
Fire !

247
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,500
Missed ?

248
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Enemy probe has
reached the Geo-Front.

249
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Hurry the second shot !

250
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Exchanging fuses.
Start recharging.

251
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Begin cooling the barrel.

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,100
High energy reaction detected
in the target again !

253
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,800
Damn it !

254
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Shinji !

255
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Ayanami !

256
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
The shield won't
be able to hold !

257
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Not yet ?

258
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
10 more seconds !

259
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Hurry !

260
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,400
Hurry !

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,900
Gotcha !

262
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,200
Ayanami !

263
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Ayanami, are you alright ?!

264
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Ayanami !

265
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't say,
``I have nothing else.''

266
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,500
Don't say a sad word
like ``goodbye'' when we go.

267
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Why are you crying ?

268
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,000
Sorry, I don't know how to express myself in situations like this.

269
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,700
You should smile.
