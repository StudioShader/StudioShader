SHIN SEIKI

00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,930
''zankoku na tenshi no youni''

00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:14,950
''shoonen yo shinwa ni nare''

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,400

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,080
''unmei sae mada shiranai itaike na hitomi''

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,190
''dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou sono senaka niwa''

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,140
''haruka mirai mezasu tame no hane ga aru koto''

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:15,430

15
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:30,650
''kono sora wo daite kagayaku shoonen yo shinwa ni nare''

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,420
It's eating the Angel.

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,110
And it's shedding the binders itself.
No one can stop Eva any more.

18
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,800
The awakening and
liberation of Unit 01...

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
...SEELE won't remain silent.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,720
The Eva series is not supposed to be equipped with the S2 organ.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,010
I didn't expect it to use such
a manner to take that in.

22
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,640
That incident was very
different from our scenario.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,650
It won't be
easy to amend.

24
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,880
Was it our mistake to have
Ikari Gendou command NERV ?

25
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,960
But only he can
complete our plan.

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,460
Ikari, what are
you thinking ?

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,290
It's begun.

28
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,860
Yeah.
Now, everything begins.

29
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,900
EPISODE 20

30
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,900
\C7Shape of Heart
( kokoro no katachi )

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,900
Shape of Human
( hito no katachi )

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,000
The damage to Eva is
exceeding ``Heiflick'' limits.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
It'll take time
to restore everything.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,940
Fortunately, it's possible to
transplant the Magi system.

35
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,600
We'll start tomorrow.

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,670
But this place is useless.

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,480
It's only a matter of time
before this place is abandoned.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,980
Right. We have to use the secondary command post for now.

39
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,140
Without Magi...?

40
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,740
Yes. Wipe the dust off and we'll be back to work this afternoon.

41
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,400
The chairs are too close together, and the sensors are tough to operate.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,190
It's not so
comfortable, is it ?

43
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,540
The layout is similar to the
first command post, though...

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,220
I just feel awkward.

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,060
At least we
can ``use'' it.

46
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,760
We're not sure if
we can use Unit 01.

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,630
Is it sufficient to
bind it in the cage ?

48
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,500
There are no signs of heat, electronic, magnetic or chemical reactions.

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,860
The S2 organ has
completely stopped.

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,830
Nevertheless, Unit 01 has
moved three times before.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,410
We shouldn't make assumptions
based on appearances.

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,800
We don't know what'll happen if we touch it carelessly.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,290
It's just like you, Katsuragi.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,500
Sorry.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,290
Eva Unit 01 is not
the only problem.

56
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,800
Exactly. Severe damage to Units 00 and 02,
massive damage to headquarters...

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,530
...exposure of Central Dogma.
Our loss is very serious.

58
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,150
We don't know how much
time and money we've lost.

59
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,770
It was because we didn't put
a bell around Ikari's neck.

60
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,500
The bell was there,
but it didn't ring.

61
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,600
A silent bell is useless.
Have the bell take action this time.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,580
It was an unexpected
development, wasn't it ?

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,490
The committee...What's the excuse you'll use with SEELE ?

64
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,220
Unit 01 wasn't under our control.
It was an unfortunate accident.

65
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,220
So, I'll restrain Unit 01 until the committee answers me.

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,200
That's an appropriate reaction.

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,930
But your son's still inside.

68
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,360
It didn't work after all. It doesn't accept the ejection signal to the entry plug.

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,890
What about the back-up
and simulated signals ?

70
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,800
They've been rejected. I can't establish a direct connection.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,870
The visual line to the plug has been connected. I'm displaying it on the main monitor.

72
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,300
What's going on ?

73
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,830
That's the true meaning of the
400 percent of the synchro ratio.

74
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,760
No. Then what
happened to Shinji ?

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,300
He was assimilated
into Eva Unit 01.

76
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,990
What do you mean ?
What is Eva ?

77
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,990
All I can say is that it's a human shaped object created by humans.

78
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,850
Created by humans...? You just copied the one you found in Antarctica, didn't you ?

79
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,480
How could that
be an original ?

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,490
It's not an ordinary copy,
because it has a human will.

81
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,460
Do you mean that this
was someone's decision ?

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,900
Or maybe Eva's.

83
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,450
Do something !

84
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,440
You built it, didn't you ?!
Take your responsibility to the end !

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,850
The government and the Ministry of the Interior officially denied it.

86
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:15,270
Next news...It's been a month since the terrorist attack by a sect in Tokyo-2.

87
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,970
To prevent another
terrorist attack...

88
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm still alive.

89
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,900
I understand that
she's alright !

90
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,370
Don't call me about
stuff like that, Misato !

91
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,750
I...I couldn't do anything.

92
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,070
I lost to that
idiotic Shinji.

93
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,200
So frustrating...

94
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,330
Salvage plan for Shinji...?

95
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,410
Yes.  Shinji's life
components still exist.

96
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,460
You respect a human life now ?

97
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,780
We can't lose Shinji now.

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,640
I wonder. NERV wants Unit 01 as its puppet, not Shinji's life, right ?

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,100
I don't deny that.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,760
We think that Shinji's body lost its cohesion and its particles were freed in the entry plug.

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,800
You mean Shinji turned into
particles that we can't see ?

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,700
Yes. The LCL components in the plug have been chemically changed...

103
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,600
...and it's very similar to sea water of primitive Earth.

104
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
The soup of life...?

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,250
All Shinji's components were kept inside the plug, and his soul must be there as well.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,230
In fact, his ego has virtually
created an image of his plug suit.

107
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,900
In short, our salvage is a process to recompose his body and stabilize his soul in it.

108
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,450
Can you do that ?

109
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,970
With Magi's help.

110
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,790
Theoretically speaking, right ?
We won't know until we actually try.

111
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,570
What's that ?
Where am I ?

112
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,520
The entry plug of Unit 01 ?

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,200
But no one's there.
I'm not there either.

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,010
What's that ?
What's that ? What's that ?

115
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,520
I don't get it.

116
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,600
People...They're the people I know
and the people who know me.

117
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,650
That's right.
They're all in my own world.

118
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,670
What's that ?

119
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,790
It's supposed to be in my world,
but I don't understand.

120
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,100
An image from outside...?
A disgusting image...

121
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,830
That's right,
it's my enemy.

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy...

123
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,650
They're our enemies that
have the names of Angels.

124
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,800
Eva and NERV's target.

125
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,900
Misato's father's enemy...

126
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,940
Why am I fighting ?

127
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,300
Are you stupid ?

128
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,120
Unknown enemies are attacking us. It's natural to get rid of sparks raining down on us.

129
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,500
I wonder if I don't need a reason.

130
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
I wonder if I shouldn't think about it.

131
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,170
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
They're all enemies.

132
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,910
Someone who threatens me and us,
in other words, the enemy.

133
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,000
What's wrong with defending
ourselves with our own hands ?

134
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Enemy, enemy, enemy,
enemy, my enemy...

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,660
My enemy...!

136
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,300
Damn, damn, damn...

137
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,530
You hurt Touji
and killed Mother !

138
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,050
Father...

139
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,310
Why do you
hate your father ?

140
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,250
It's natural.
A father like him...

141
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't you understand your father ?

142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,980
Of course not, because
I haven't seen him very often.

143
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,620
Is that why you
hate your father ?

144
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,210
Yes. He doesn't need me.
He deserted me.

145
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,030
Am I a substitute for you ?

146
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,570
That's right !
You must be !

147
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,240
I was deserted
because you were there !

148
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,600
You ran away yourself.

149
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,230
Shut up, shut up, shut up !
It was all Father's fault !

150
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,800
I was going to say,
``I hate you'' at that time, but...

151
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,030
Are you saying that I have to pilot that and frighten myself...?

152
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,980
That's right.

153
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,840
Why ?
I don't want to !

154
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,250
Why now ?
I thought you didn't need me !

155
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,100
I called you
because I need you.

156
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,120
Why me ?

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,500
Because no one else can.

158
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,890
I can't. I can't do it because I haven't seen or heard anything about it !

159
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,920
No. I knew it.
I knew Eva...

160
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,070
...and I ran away from Father
and Mother at that moment.

161
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,350
NEON GENESIS

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,750
Currently, the LCL temperature
is being maintained at 36.

163
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,190
No problem in
oxygen density.

164
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,340
Radial electromagnetic pulse, nominal. Wave pattern, B.

165
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,100
All equipment working normally.

166
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,990
You completed the outline of the salvage plan in a month. It's just like you.

167
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,140
Unfortunately, the original idea's not mine. This is experimental data from 10 years ago.

168
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,100
Did it happen during Eva's development, 10 years ago ?

169
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,450
It was long before
I arrived here.

170
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,170
My mother seemed to be observing,
but I only know the data.

171
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,300
What was the
result that time ?

172
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,110
They failed.

173
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,590
Kind...

174
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,410
...warm...

175
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,670
...is this human warmth ?

176
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,210
I didn't know this.

177
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,100
What's loneliness ?

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,780
I didn't know, but I feel like I can understand it now.

179
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,570
What's happiness ?

180
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,580
I didn't know, but I feel like I can understand it now.

181
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,370
Does everyone act
kind to you ?

182
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,430
Yes.

183
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,840
Why ?

184
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,190
It's because I'm the Eva pilot.  Because I pilot Eva, they treat me very well.

185
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,270
That's the reason
why I can stay here.

186
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,680
It's everything
I depend upon.

187
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,530
So, I have to pilot Eva.

188
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,810
Then...?

189
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,200
Enemy...I have to fight against what they call the enemy.

190
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,510
Then...?

191
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,080
I have to win. Yes.
I mustn't be defeated.

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,300
I have to pilot Eva as they say, and I have to win as they say.

193
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,160
Otherwise...no one...

194
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,700
...no one...

195
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,730
...no one...

196
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,760
Good luck.

197
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,720
Good luck.

198
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,080
What're you doing ?
Do it right.

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,230
Good luck.

200
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,430
Good luck.

201
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,190
Well done, Shinji.

202
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,500
Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka,
Touji, Kensuke...

203
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,840
...and Father...
They praise me...

204
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,340
They praise me
if I pilot Eva.

205
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,070
Everyone suggests someone like me pilot it. My father does, too.

206
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll make my father have
a better opinion of me.

207
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,300
Good luck.

208
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm doing well.
I am.

209
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,010
Be kind to me.

210
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,080
I fought well, and I'm
trying to fight so hard !

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,430
Treat me well.
Be kind to me !

212
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,030
I'm kind to you.

213
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,750
Say, Shinji...do you
want to join with me ?

214
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,420
Do you want your body and soul to join with mine ?

215
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,500
It's very very comfortable.

216
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,880
It's alright.
I'm ready anytime.

217
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,510
Hey, idiotic Shinji...do you want to join with me ?

218
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you want your body and soul to join with mine ?

219
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,160
It's very very comfortable.

220
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,300
I'm asking you.
Come on now.

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
Ikari...do you want
to join with me ?

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
Do you want your body and soul to join with mine ?

223
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,730
It's very very comfortable.

224
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,070
Ikari...

225
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,060
Do you want to
join with me ?

226
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,400
Do you want your body and soul to join with mine ?

227
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,100
It's very very comfortable.

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't worry.
Open your mind.

229
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,810
All inducing rods are inserted.

230
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,190
Electromagnetic wave's fixed to zero minus three.

231
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,380
Psychic essence threshold
pulse has been connected.

232
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,650
Roger.
Start salvage.

233
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,000
Roger. I'm sending
the first signal.

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,830
Eva's received the signal.
No rejection occurred.

235
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,600
Start sending the second
and the third signal.

236
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,450
Catechizes normal.

237
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,440
No anomalies

238
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,010
Roger. Move on
to stage two.

239
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,200
Shinji.

240
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,050
Idiotic Shinji.

241
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,500
Shinji.

242
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Hey, Shinji.

243
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,450
Yo, Shinji.

244
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,420
Ikari.

245
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,160
Shinji.

246
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,950
Idiotic Shinji.

247
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,630
Shinji.

248
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,340
Hey, Shinji.

249
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,950
Yo, Shinji.

250
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,630
Ikari...

251
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,120
It's not working.
Psychic threshold's fixed in a loop.

252
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,500
Radiate wave patterns
in every range.

253
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,290
It's no good, the signal's
trapped inside the Cline space.

254
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,400
What do you mean ?

255
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,500
We've failed.

256
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,000
Stop the intervention.
Reverse the tangent graph.

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,410
Set adding
parameters to zero.

258
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,200
Okay.

259
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,950
There's an anomalous sign in the old area. Pattern sepia.

260
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,610
There's a change in core pulse !
Plus 0.3, confirmed !

261
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,750
Maintain current status.
Prevent reverse flow.

262
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,280
Okay.

263
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,830
Plus 0.5...0.8. Something's wrong.
I can't stop it.

264
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,100
That's...
Why is it...?

265
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,900
Don't you want
to come back, Shinji ?

266
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,300
I don't know.

267
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't know.

268
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,600
I...

269
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,090
I...

270
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,100
What do you want ?

271
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,850
What do you want ?

272
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,500
What do you want ?

273
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
What do you want ?

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,580
Eva refused the signal !

275
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,720
LCL components
breaking down !

276
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,350
Pressure's rising
inside the plug !

277
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,490
Stop everything !
Shut down the power !

278
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,430
It's not working !
The plug's going to eject !

279
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,000
Shinji...!

280
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,530
Where am I ?

281
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,780
Inside Eva.

282
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,650
Inside Eva...?

283
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,610
Did I pilot Eva again ?
Why ?

284
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,550
Don't you want
to pilot Eva ?

285
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,100
I decided not
to pilot Eva.

286
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,500
But you piloted
Evangelion Unit 01 again.

287
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,640
Shinji, you're here
because you pilot Eva.

288
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,550
Because you piloted Eva,
you became as you are now.

289
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:16,700
You can't deny the fact that you piloted Eva, nor your present or past self.

290
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,700
You should decide what you're going to do from this moment on.

291
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,600
I...

292
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,590
I...

293
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,380
Only one person...we couldn't even save one person. What is science for ?

294
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,300
Give Shinji back.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Give him back !

296
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,350
Smell...the smell of a human...?

297
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,060
Misato...?

298
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,110
Ayanami...?

299
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,800
No, it's not.

300
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,620
That's right.
It's the smell of Mother.

301
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,580
He has to live after the Second Impact, doesn't he ?~~In this hell...

302
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,400
If he wants to survive,
anywhere could be like Heaven.

303
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,620
He has a chance to be happy anytime because he's alive.

304
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,100
I see.
You're right.

305
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,210
Mother...

306
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,220
Have you decided ?

307
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,030
Shinji for a boy
and Rei for a girl.

308
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,010
Shinji, Rei...

309
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,690
Mother...

310
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,800
Shinji !

311
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,700
The repair work for Unit 01 will be done by the day after tomorrow.

312
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Humans use the power of God as a tool after all.

313
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,900
I don't know. The committee has proposed restraining it.

314
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,680
Artificial humanoid Evangelion...

315
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,100
The unknown black box seems too large for a thing humans created, don't you think ?

316
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, Shinji was saved
in the end, so it's okay.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,270
I didn't do it.

318
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,090
It was probably
because of you.

319
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,670
How about a drink ?
It's been a while, right ?

320
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,050
Sorry, but I have
something to do.

321
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,000
I see.

322
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,190
Bye.

323
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,100
As soon as Shinji's safety is confirmed,
she's off to meet a guy.

324
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,800
I shouldn't talk.

325
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,100
Ritsuko probably despises me and thinks that I'm an indecent woman.

326
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,200
It's more realistic to be addicted to desire as a human. I can be deceitful then.

327
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,280
Deceive our intelligence,
Commander Ikari or Ritsuko ?

328
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,210
Or me ?

329
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,800
No.~~Myself.

330
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,500
Someone else, right ?

331
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
You're not interested in others,
but you hate loneliness.

332
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
You're just
like my father.

333
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,900
You still smoke ?

334
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,750
I only smoke after things like this.
So you're the only one who knows.

335
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm honored.

336
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,040
So, how far has the
Human Complement Project progressed ?

337
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,720
Why is Adam, which might destroy humanity, kept underground ?

338
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,250
You're meeting me
to find that out.

339
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,560
Honestly speaking,
that's part of the reason.

340
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm happy to be used by a woman, but I can't tell you in a place like this.

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,390
It's alright as long as I can make you understand how I feel.

342
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,310
What's NERV and
Commander Ikari's true purpose ?

343
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,010
That's what I want to know.

344
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,860
Hey, you can't avoid
the subject by doing this.
