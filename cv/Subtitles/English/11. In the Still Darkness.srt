NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,300
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:14,400
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,800
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:37,900
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:44,700
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,100
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,500
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,600
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,700
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,200
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah !
I hit it, I hit it !

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
Coin Cleaning

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
Hour

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Cleaning doesn't come cheap.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,200
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,900
I wish I had time to
do them at home, don't you ?

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,300
You're lucky, at least
you had time to go home.

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Oh, Sub-Commander.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Good morning.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
Good morning, sir.

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,700
Morning.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
You're early today.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,000
I went to the
upper town for Ikari.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I see. It's the committee's regular meeting today, I suppose.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,900
Boring job. Ikari always
forces trivial duties on me.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,600
If not for Magi,
I wouldn't know what to do.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
A city council election will
take place above soon.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,700
The city council is just a puppet.
Magi is truly in charge of the city.

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,900
Magi. Those three
super computers are...?

35
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,300
Those three computers decide
everything by majority rule.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,600
The system follows the
fundamentals of democracy.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Does the council only
follow Magi's decisions ?

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,900
It's an effective government
which minimizes waste.

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,200
It's indeed the city of science.
It's an era when science is omnipotent.

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
What an old-fashioned phrase.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,700
Come to think, you have an experiment involving Unit 00, don't you ?

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Yes, starting
at 10:30 today...

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,100
...the second experiment for improving the activation time is scheduled.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm expecting good news.

45
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,700
Abort the experiment.
Cut the circuits.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
The circuits
are switched.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,100
Power supply recovering.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,900
This is a
problem after all.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,100
Yes. I'm worried that the conversion efficiency is lower than the theoretical value by 0.008.

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
It's within the maximum error measurement. What should we do ?

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,500
Lower the interconversion by 0.01 and try it again with the same setting.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Roger.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,400
Start reactivation experiment.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Episode 11

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,100
In the Still Dark

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Hey !
Just a moment !

57
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
Man, I ran and ran.

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,700
You seem to be in
a bad mood today.

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,200
It's because I saw YOU
just after I arrived.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
Yes. Hold a
moment, please.

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,300
What ?

62
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,000
Um...umm...
Well, Father...

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
What's the matter ?
Be quick !

64
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Umm, well...

65
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,400
Today...at school...

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:56,100
...I was told to tell my parent that a career guidance interview will take place.

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,700
I've entrusted Katsuragi
with those things.

68
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't call me for such trivial things.
Don't make phone calls like this.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,700
What the...?

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
A blackout ?

71
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,000
No way,
that can't happen.

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000
Something's wrong.
An accident...?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,900
Did Akagi screw
up an experiment ?

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,900
Main power supply down.
Voltage zero.

75
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,300
It...it wasn't me.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
I wonder...

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,900
But the auxiliary power
supply should come on soon.

78
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,800
It's no use. The auxiliary
circuit isn't operating.

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,500
Impossible. How many
circuits are operational ?

80
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,100
1.2 percent in all !
Only 9 circuits from No. 2567 !

81
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,200
Use all operating power supplies
to maintain Magi and Central Dogma.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,900
But that will affect the life support systems in every building.

83
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,600
That's alright !
They're top priority.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Remember Takahasi Nozomu, Takahashi Nozomu. Thank you for your support.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,100
She's really lazy.

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,300
I think Katsuragi should
get her own laundry.

87
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,900
Wha...?

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,900
It was because
Commander Ikari's too busy.

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,300
I wonder. It was like I failed or something rather than his hanging up.

90
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,900
Geez. You're a man, why don't you stop worrying about the small stuff ?

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,200
What ?

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
What're you doing ?
Hey, let me do it !

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Damn it !
It must be broken !

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Anyway, we've got to get
to the control center.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
The power's been out
for seven minutes.

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,100
Something's very wrong.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
How's this
place powered ?

98
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Three systems:
Main, sub and auxiliary.

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't believe that all
three failed simultaneously.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
That means...

101
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,900
...we'd better assume that someone's tripped the breakers instead of a system failure.

102
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,700
No matter what caused this, we'll be in big trouble if an Angel appears.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,400
An unidentified object's been
detected by search radar.

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,600
Expected landing location...
former Atami area.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,400
It may be
the eighth one.

106
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Yes.
It must be an Angel.

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,300
What should we do ?

108
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Take an alert position.
That's standard procedure.

109
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
Its destination is Tokyo-3.

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,900
Right, but we
can't do anything.

111
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
The Angel has landed.

112
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,100
It's still coming.

113
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
And Tokyo-3 ?

114
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,600
It's still silent.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,300
What on earth are those
Nerv guys doing ?

116
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,600
I thought that a ladder was
just an old-fashioned ornament.

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,100
I never imagined
that I'd use one.

118
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
They say,
preparation is prevention.

119
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
This doesn't
work either.

120
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,200
None of the facilities work.
It's strange.

121
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
You mean something's
happened below ?

122
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
It's a natural conclusion.

123
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Anyway, let's contact
Nerv Headquarters.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,900
No use. Even the emergency
phone doesn't work.

125
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,700
No use. Line 77
isn't operating either.

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
No, I can't
make contact.

127
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I can't either.
Even the emergency line is out.

128
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
What should we do ?

129
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
What're you doing ?

130
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,600
Are you stupid ?!
There's an emergency manual !

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Anyway, let's go
to Headquarters.

132
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, let's choose the leader of our group before we go into action.

133
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,500
And of course,
I'll be the leader.

134
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,900
Any objections ?

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,500
Let's go !

136
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,800
We can go down through
Route-07 over there.

137
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
But the doors
don't work, right ?

138
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
Oh, a manual door...

139
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
Alright, Shinji.
It's your turn.

140
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,100
You only rely on me
in situations like this.

141
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,600
That damn Joint Staff Council only relies on us frontliners in situations like this.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,500
What's the
government saying ?

143
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,900
The guys in Tokyo-2 ?
I heard they're preparing to escape.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,300
The Angel is
still advancing.

145
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Anyway, we have to
contact Nerv.

146
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
But how ?

147
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,800
Go yourself.

148
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,700
This's the Third District
Japan Air Self-Defense Force.

149
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,100
An unidentified object is currently approaching this area.

150
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,900
Residents, please go to your designated shelters as soon as possible.

151
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh, no ! I have
to report to HQ...

152
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,000
...but how ?

153
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,100
Remember Takahashi, Takahashi Nozomu,
who is unperturbed even in an emergency.

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Lucky !

155
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,400
It's really hot.

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,700
The air conditioners
aren't working.

157
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Katsuragi, if you can't stand the heat,
you could at least take off your shirt.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,100
There's no reason
to be shy, is there ?

159
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,400
Even if the situation comes up,
don't get any weird ideas.

160
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,900
Okay, okay.

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,900
This's bad.
The air's stagnating.

162
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,400
These facilities are supposed to be the pinnacle of modern science.

163
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,000
But, that's just like the
Commander and Sub-Commander.

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,100
They aren't bothered
by this much heat.

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,800
It's lukewarm.

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,900
Yeah.

167
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,300
NEON GENESIS

168
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Due to this district's special state of emergency, an emergency vehicle is going...

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,300
It's a dead end,
you know ?!

170
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,700
It's okay ! Go in,
it's an emergency !

171
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
Alright !

172
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,800
No, please stop !

173
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,400
The Geo-front was designed
to be self-sufficient...

174
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,600
...even if it's isolated
from the outside.

175
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,100
Theoretically, it's impossible for all the power supplies fail.

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,900
Which means somebody
did it deliberately.

177
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,600
I guess their purpose is
to investigate this place.

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,900
They want to examine the structure of HQ
through its recovery procedures.

179
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
Annoying guys.

180
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,700
I'll run a dummy program on Magi to make it difficult for them to grasp the whole.

181
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,300
I'll leave it to you.

182
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,500
The first damage to Headquarters was done by humans rather than an Angel...

184
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
I can't bear
the thought.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
After all, humanity's
enemy is a human.

186
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,200
It usually takes two minutes to get there. Is this the right passage ?

187
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,100
If we reach it, I'm sure
we can enter the Geo-front.

188
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,300
I've heard the same
phrase four times already.

189
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,700
You're always thinking too
much about the small stuff.

190
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Be quiet.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
What is it,
Miss Honor Student ?!

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
I hear a voice.

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
It's Hyuga !

194
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
It's Hyuga !

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Hey ! Hey !

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Hey ! Hey !

197
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,400
An Angel's approaching !
Repeat; an Angel's approaching !

198
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,300
An Angel's
approaching...?!

199
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,300
An Angel's
approaching...?!

200
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,500
We mustn't waste time.
Let's take a shortcut.

201
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm the leader. Don't take
control without my permission.

202
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,800
So, where's the shortcut ?

203
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,100
Damn, even though this
is a shortcut, I look so bad.

204
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Say, what do you
think the Angels are ?

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
What're you
talking about ?

206
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,900
Angels, messengers of God.
Our enemies with the name of Angels.

207
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
Why're we
fighting them ?

208
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,300
Are you stupid ?
Unknown enemies are attacking us.

209
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,600
It's natural that we have to
``get rid of sparks raining down on us.''{<- an analogy)

210
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,500
I say right.

211
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,400
To the left,
in my opinion.

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Don't bother me !
What do you think, Shinji ?!

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,300
Well...

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,100
...I don't know.

215
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,600
Geez, I'm the leader,
so you should follow me !

216
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,700
As I expected, something seems strange.
This passage leads up.

217
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,100
What do you mean, ``As I expected ?''
You always say too much.

218
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,400
See ! I'm sure
I'm right this time.

219
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
We visually verified there's an Angel. Now we're sure that we have to hurry, right ?

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
An Angel's approaching. I suggest that Eva should be readied for combat.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, no.

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
Fuyutsuki, I leave
the rest to you.

223
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Ikari...

224
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm going to the cage to
prepare the Evas for combat.

225
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,300
You mean you're going
to do it manually ?

226
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,900
We have a diesel
for emergencies.

227
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
But...

228
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,300
...we have no pilots.

229
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,800
Again.

230
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,000
This way.

231
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
You're Commander Ikari's
favorite, aren't you ?

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,000
You see, the beloved honor
student is different from us.

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Stop saying such things
at a time like this.

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,600
You always stay calm.

235
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,800
Hey, don't screw with me just because you're the favorite !

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm not screwing with you...

237
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
...nor am I the favorite.

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,300
I know it
all too well.

239
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,700
Roger. Termination signal
plug has been extracted.

240
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,000
OK. Prepare to insert the
entry plugs into all three Evas.

241
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,900
But, we don't have
any pilots yet.

242
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't worry.
I'm sure they'll come.

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,100
We can't open
this door by hand.

244
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,900
It can't be helped. We'll force
open the duct and go through it.

245
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,100
The ``First'' is scary.

246
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
She's the kind of person who stops at nothing to achieve her objectives.

247
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
She's a self-righteous one.

248
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
We've completed
placing the plugs.

249
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,700
All we need now
are those children.

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,900
Don't look ahead no matter what.
If you do, I'll kill you.

251
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,900
You Idiot !

252
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Idiot, idiot !
I told you not to look !

253
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
What could I do ?
If I don't look ahead...

254
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,100
You guys...

255
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
All units,
prepare for entry.

256
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,200
Roger. Open the
hatches manually.

257
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
How're the Evas ?

258
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
They're ready.

259
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Nothing's working though...

260
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,600
We did it by human hands.
It was the Commander's idea.

261
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,500
Father's...

262
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,400
Commander Ikari's been preparing,
believing that you'd come.

263
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
Plugs inserted.

264
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,800
All units were activated
with auxiliary power sources.

265
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,000
Remove the first lock bolt.

266
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,300
Release hydraulic
locks 2 thru 32.

267
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Pressure zero.
They're free.

268
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,400
OK. Everyone, remove the
bindings by force, and move out.

269
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,300
The target's staying
directly above us.

270
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,200
Hurry up.

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Emergency batteries attached.

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Good. They're ready.
Move out !

273
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,400
Geez, I look so uncool !

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
We're nearing
the pit.

275
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh man, I look
so uncool again !

276
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, no.
Dodge it !

277
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,300
No !

278
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,400
The target's trying to invade HQ directly using a strong solvent liquid.

279
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
What should we do ?

280
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,700
We'll defeat it,
of course !

281
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,100
But how ? I dropped my rifle and the batteries on our backs are empty.

282
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,000
We can only move
for three more minutes.

283
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,000
I have a plan.

284
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,700
The defense stays here...

285
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
...neutralizing the AT-field and shielding the offense from the Angel's solvent liquid.

286
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,200
The backup goes down, picks up the rifle and gives it to the offense.

287
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,600
Then the offense destroys the target with a salvo from the rifle. How's that ?

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Okay.
I'll be the defense.

289
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,200
Sorry, but...

290
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,100
...I'll do it.

291
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,700
It's so dangerous.

292
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,900
That's why. I'd feel bad if I left my debt unpaid from the last battle.

293
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Shinji's the offense.
Miss Honor Student is the backup.

294
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Alright ?

295
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Okay.

296
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,600
Alright, let's go !

297
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Ayanami !

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Asuka, get out
of the way !

299
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,100
I've paid off my debt.

300
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Damn, why won't this open ?!
It's an emergency !

301
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,800
I can't stand this...!

302
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Hey, I told you
not to look up !

303
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,900
Okay, okay.

304
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Dirty...

305
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,400
It's ironic that the stars look so beautiful without artificial lights.

306
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,800
But, I don't feel like people live there without the lights.

307
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,100
See ? That makes
me feel better.

308
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Mankind fears the darkness and scrapes it away with fire to survive.

309
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,800
So philosophical !

310
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I wonder if man is a special creature because of that.

311
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,300
Is that why the
Angels are attacking us ?

312
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,100
Are you stupid ?

313
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,200
How're we
supposed to know ?

Misato's career has been a crusade to exterminate the Angels.

322
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Shinji finds a similar sentiment within himself.

323
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
The largest Angel yet comes flying through the stratosphere,

324
