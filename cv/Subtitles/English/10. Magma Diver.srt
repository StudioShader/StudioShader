00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm lucky !
I get to shop with you !

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,100
What the...?
This's the swimsuit section.

18
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,200
Hey, how about this ?!

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,900
Isn't that a bit too much for a middle school student ?

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,000
You're so far
behind the times.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100
This kind of suit is
quite common these days.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,300
Is that so ?

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,900
It's for our school trip,
I want to feel relaxed.

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,200
Where are you going ?

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,500
O

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Oki

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Okina

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Okinawa.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Scuba-diving is on
the schedule, too.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,200
Scuba-diving...

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,500
I haven't gone diving
for three years.

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,200
Where'd you go
for your school trip ?

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
We didn't have one.

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
How come ?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
The Second Impact.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
Episode #10

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
Magma Diver

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,300
We can't go on
our school trip ?!

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Right.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,300
Why not ?

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,700
You must be on alert.

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
I hadn't heard that.

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
I just told you.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Who decided that ?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,300
I did, as the
Operations Planning Manager.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,200
Hey, stop drinking tea,
and say something !

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
You're a man,
aren't you ?!

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,400
I expected
this to happen.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,300
Already given up...?

50
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah.

51
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,900
How pathetic.
A tame  guy's terrible.

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,100
Don't say it that way.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I know how you feel,
but it can't be helped.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,600
An Angel might attack
while you're gone.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,800
We always have to wait.
Wait wait wait.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
We always have to wait for the enemy,
even though we don't know when they'll come.

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Why don't you find
it first, then attack ?

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
If we could,
we would.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, you must think
of this as a good chance.

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,900
While the others are gone,
you can study.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Did you think I wasn't
aware of THESE ?

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,100
You're mistaken if you think
you can hide them from me.

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,000
I can easily obtain the information on how well you did on exams.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Ridiculous. What's with
this academic achievement ?

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm not interested in the old fashioned
exams of the demerit system.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,200
In Rome, do as the Romans do.
I hope you get used to Japanese schools.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,500
No way !

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,500
Asuka, I'll bring
you a souvenir !

69
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,800
I feel sorry
for you guys.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,900
We'll have fun for you !

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Paste the data of Mt. Asama from Balthazar to Melchior smoothly.

72
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,100
School trip ?

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,500
They're too relaxed
at a time like this.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Because of times like these,
they want to play while they can.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Whatcha doin' ?

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,100
Studying science.

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, you're so obedient.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,300
But I have to.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,700
Ta da !

80
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Since I can't go scuba diving
in Okinawa, I'll dive here.

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
I see.

82
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, what're you doin' ?
Let me see.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Can't you even solve an
easy equation like this ?

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
There, it's done.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
It's simple.

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,300
If you can solve a difficult problem like this,
how come you did bad on the exams ?

87
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,700
I couldn't understand what
was written on the exam.

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,000
You mean you couldn't
read the questions in Japanese ?

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,900
That's right. I haven't
mastered all the Kanji yet.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
I didn't study
it at college.

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
College ?

92
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
Yup.
I graduated last year.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,200
What's this about ?

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
This's a problem
about thermal expansion.

95
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Thermal expansion ?
How elementary.

96
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,100
In short, things swell
and get bigger when heated...

97
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
...and shrink and get
smaller when cooled, right ?

98
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
I know that, but...

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,500
In my case, do you think my
breasts'll get bigger when heated ?

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,400
Don't ask me,
I have no idea.

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,900
Boring guy.

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,600
Look look, Shinji !

103
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
Backroll Entry !

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,100
These don't give
us a clear image.

105
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,800
But, this spot reported by Asamayama Earthquake Research Institute bothers me.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Of course,
we can't ignore that.

107
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,700
What did Magi say ?

108
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,400
Fifty - fifty.

109
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Is someone there ?

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,500
Capt. Katsuragi's
already there.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,800
That's the limit !

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Not yet.
500 more, please.

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Depth 1200.
Anti-pressure armor cracked.

114
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,000
Katsuragi !

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,900
If it breaks, we'll compensate for it.
200 more, please.

116
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,900
Contact on the monitor.

117
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
Start analysis.

118
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,800
Okay.

119
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,100
Probe crushed
and imploded.

120
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,000
How was the analysis ?

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,200
We barely got it.
Pattern is blue.

122
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,500
No doubt.
That's an Angel.

123
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,300
This lab's now completely closed
and is under Nerv's control.

124
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,900
No one's allowed to enter, and all events for the last 6 hours must remain secret.

125
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,500
Request A-17
from Commander Ikari.

126
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,400
Be careful,
this line's unsecured.

127
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,700
I know, hurry and switch
to the secure line.

128
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
A-17 ?

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
You mean our
side'll attack first ?

130
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,100
Yes.

131
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,800
No, it's too dangerous. Don't tell me you've forgotten what happened 15 years ago ?

132
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
It's our chance.

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,300
We've done nothing but defend; now we can go on the offensive for the first time.

134
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
It's too risky.

135
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,500
But, you know how important a living sample of an Angel is.

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,700
Failure is unacceptable.

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,900
Failure ? In that case,
all humanity will be lost.

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Are you really sure ?

139
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,200
That's an Angel ?

140
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Yes. It's something like
a pupa before maturity.

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,100
Our primary objective
is to capture the Angel.

142
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,800
Capture it alive and preserve the original form as much as possible.

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,100
If we fail...?

144
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
Destroy it as
soon as possible. Got it ?

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,100
Yes.

146
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Who's gonna do this ?

147
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,500
Me, me !
I'll dive !

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
But, it'll probably
be me again.

149
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,600
Asuka.

150
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
You'll do it
with Unit 02.

151
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes !
It's a piece of cake !

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
And me ?

153
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,100
The special equipment won't fit
on a prototype such as Unit 00.

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
You're ordered to stay
at HQ with Unit 00.

155
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Alright.

156
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,600
Too bad you can't
go to the hot spring.

157
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Since A-17 was issued, we'll leave as soon as possible. Get ready.

158
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Even though you said this is an anti-heat plug suit, there's nothing different.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,900
Push the right switch.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Oh, no !

162
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,500
What is this ?!

163
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Unit 02 is ready.

164
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,500
No, what's that ?!

165
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,700
Special anti-heat, anti-pressure,
and anti-nuclear suits.

166
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
Type-D equipment
for extreme regions.

167
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,700
Is that my Unit 02 ?

168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,800
No, I won't go !

169
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't want to be
seen in public like this !

170
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,900
Shinji's more suitable
for this kind of job !

171
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,800
That's disappointing. I thought I'd get to see your brave actions.

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,500
Oh, no !

173
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm not bold enough to
let Kaji see me like this.

174
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
It's a problem, isn't it ?

175
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,300
It is.

176
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
Then, I'll...

177
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,800
I'll go with Unit 02.

178
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Sorry, but I don't want
YOU touching my Unit 02 !

179
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,300
If the First has to,
I'd rather go.

180
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,000
It's ugly,
but please be patient.

181
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
NEON GENESIS

182
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Eva Unit 01 and
Unit 02 have arrived.

183
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,800
Both units, wait for
orders at present positions.

184
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,700
Prepare the laser shot
and the crane, quickly.

185
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,400
Roger.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh, where's Kaji ?

187
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,300
That idiot won't come.
He doesn't have a job here.

188
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Darn, I wanted to show
him my excellent work.

189
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,800
A-17's been ordered. That also means seizure of the present assets.

190
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
That puts a lot of
people in trouble.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
Why didn't
you stop him ?

192
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,400
There's no reason to stop.
The order's official.

193
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
But, if Nerv fails,
it means the end of the world.

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,800
They're not that arrogant.

195
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
What's that ?

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,700
The U.N. Airforce is
on alert above us...

197
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
...until the end
of this operation.

198
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,000
Are they gonna help us ?

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,300
No. They'll take care
of the aftermath.

200
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,800
If we fail...

201
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
What do you mean ?

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,600
They'll burn the Angel with
an N2 bomb, along with us.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
How terrible !

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,300
Who'd order such a thing ?

205
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,200
Commander Ikari.

206
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,100
Laser operation complete.

207
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,200
Course secured.

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Type-D equipment, no problem.

209
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,100
Unit 02's ready to go.

210
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Roger.
Asuka, are you ready ?

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Anytime.

212
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Go !

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wow, it looks hot !

214
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,600
Unit 02's entering the lava.

215
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,500
Look look, Shinji !

216
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,600
Giant Stroke Entry !

217
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Present depth 170, descending speed 20.
Everything's operating normally.

218
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,200
Visibility zero.
I can't see anything.

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm switching
to the CT monitor.

220
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,200
The range of the scope
is still only 120.

221
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,500
Depth 400.

222
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,600
450.

223
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
500.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
550.

225
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,900
600.

226
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
650.

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,500
900.

228
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
950.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,300
1000.

230
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
1020.

231
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,100
Passed the
safe depth.

232
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Depth 1300. This is
the predicted target point.

233
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,400
Asuka, can you
see anything ?

234
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,300
Nothing.
It's not here.

235
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,300
The lava flow is
faster than expected.

236
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,200
There's some error
in target speed.

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Recalculate, quickly. Continue the operation. Descend farther.

238
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
Depth 1350.

239
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,700
1400...

240
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Second circulation
pipe cracked.

241
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,500
Depth 1480.

242
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,800
Past max depth limit.

243
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,900
It hasn't encountered
the target. Continue.

244
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Asuka, what's your status ?

245
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,200
It's still holding. I wanna complete the job soon and take a shower.

246
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
I know a nice
hot spring nearby.

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,600
We'll go there when it's done,
so hang in there a little more.

248
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Max depth, plus 120

249
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,200
Eva Unit 02 lost
its Prog'knife.

250
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,900
Max depth, plus 200.

251
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,100
Katsuragi, stop !
It's manned this time.

252
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm in charge of
the operation. Continue.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
She's right.
Don't worry, I can go farther.

254
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,000
Depth 1780. Predicted target
position after recalculation.

255
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
There.

256
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,500
Target, visually confirmed.

257
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,300
Prepare for capture.

258
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Since both are driven by the flow, you only have one chance for contact.

259
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
I know. Trust me.

260
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,900
30 to target contact.

261
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,900
Relative speed 2.2.
I'm on the line of axis.

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,300
Electromagnetic cage expanded.
No problem. Target captured.

263
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,300
Nice, Asuka.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Capture operation complete.
Ascending.

265
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Asuka, are you alright ?

266
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Of course !

267
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,900
It's easier to do it than worry about it, you know ? It was easy.

268
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,400
But, this is more like
a sauna suit than plug suit.

269
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I wanna go to
a hot spring.

270
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,100
Sounds like her
tension's gone.

271
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Really ?

272
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,300
You've also been worried
about today's operation, right ?

273
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,200
More or less. If we fail,
there'd be another one.

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Yes. Second Impact...
I don't want that again.

275
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
What's going on ?!

276
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,700
No, it's begun emerging.
It's earlier than calculated.

277
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,800
How about the cage ?

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
It won't hold !

279
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,900
Abort the capture operation.
Drop the cage.

280
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,000
Change the operation !
Angel's destruction is the top priority !

281
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,800
Unit 02, withdraw and
prepare for battle !

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,700
That's what I want !

283
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,000
Damn, I dropped the knife !

284
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,000
From the front ?!

285
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Release the ballast !

286
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,700
It's fast !

287
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
This isn't good.
I lost sight of the target.

288
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,700
In addition, visibility's bad, it's hot,
and the suit is sweaty and disgusting.

289
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,500
This sucks.

290
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Asuka, Unit 01 will
drop its knife. Catch it.

291
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Roger !

292
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Damn, haven't you
dropped it yet, Shinji ?

293
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
40 to knife's arrival.

294
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,000
The Angel's rapidly approaching.

295
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,600
No, stay away  !

296
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Hey, come on, quick !

297
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,000
Damn it ! Too slow !

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,900
Damn it !

299
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,100
I can't believe it opened
its mouth in that environment.

300
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,800
It has an
incredible structure.

301
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,300
Right leg damaged.

302
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Anti-heat process !

303
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,500
Damn you !

304
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,600
High temperature and high pressure. It can still withstand that kind of critical situation.

305
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
The Prog'knife won't work.

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
What should we do ?!

307
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,700
I got it !

308
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,700
That's it !

309
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
You bastard !

310
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,900
I see.
It's the thermal expansion !

311
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,500
Redirect all cooling pressure to number three !~~Hurry !

312
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
I did it, but...

313
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
...is this really the end ?

314
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Shinji...?

315
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Dummy. You're pushing
yourself too hard.

316
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,000
Hello, is there
anybody here from Nerv ?!

317
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,800
Coming !

318
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
Sign here, please.

319
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Thank you very much.

320
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,200
From Kaji ?
What is it ?

321
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,300
The bath is over
there to the left.

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
It's heaven, it's heaven.

323
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,400
I never realized bathing
was this relaxing.

324
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,100
Shinji, can you hear me ?!

325
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Ah, yes !

326
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
Could you throw the
body shampoo to us ?

327
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,900
The one that we
brought here ran out.

328
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,000
Okay !

329
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,100
Here it comes !

330
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,100
Okay.

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Ouch.

332
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Idiot. Watch where you
throw that, you klutz !

333
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,000
Sorry...

334
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,200
Geez, don't hit
a part like this.

335
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, let me see ?

336
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Hey, Asuka's
bubbly skin is funny.

337
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Don't touch it,
it tickles !

338
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,500
How about here ?
Or here ?

339
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,700
Don't touch it !

340
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,000
It's okay,
you won't lose anything.

341
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
It's growing...
How embarrassing.

342
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh, this ?

343
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,400
This happened because
of the Second Impact...

344
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,100
You know everything
about me, don't you ?

345
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Well, sort of.
It's my job.

346
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,200
It happened a long time ago,
so we shouldn't worry, right ?

347
