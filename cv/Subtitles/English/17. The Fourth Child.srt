00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,300
NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,300
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:14,400
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:37,900
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:44,700
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,000
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,400
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,500
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,700
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,200
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,700
You've denied us the interrogation of Unit 01's pilot...

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,600
...the only person concerned in the incident, Major Katsuragi.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,900
Yes, sir.
His emotions are unstable.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,500
I don't think it's a good idea for him to stand before you at this moment.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,100
Then, we'll question you
in his place, Major Katsuragi.

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,200
During the incident, is it true that the Angel tried to make contact with a human ?

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
The incident report doesn't suggest that.
Presumably, it was an isolated incident.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,800
So long as he
remembers correctly.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,500
No external interference with
his memory was detected.

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,900
Eva's AC recorder wasn't operating.
There's no way to confirm that.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,600
Was the Angel interested in
the human spirit or mind ?

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm not able to
answer that question.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,000
Do Angels have the concept of mind ?
Do they understand human thoughts ?

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
These are unknowns.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,100
This incident revealed the Angels' new tactic of trying to possess the Eva.

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,700
What about the possiblity of that tactic being linked to the predicted 13th Angel ?

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,300
Considering the patterns so far, systematic coupling among the Angels is negative.

33
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,100
That's right. So far, it's obvious that their actions have been independent.

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,000
What does that mean ?

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,100
You're not permitted
to ask questions.

36
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,800
Understood.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
That's it.
Dismissed.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
What do you think, Ikari ?

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,400
Angels are becoming more
and more intelligent.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
The time left is...

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,700
...``very short.''
Is that what you mean ?

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,700
Episode 17

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,700
The Fourth Child

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
The patient in room 12 ?

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,000
You mean the medical treatment given during Incident E ?~~That was a while ago.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
That was a
very serious injury.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,500
She's still
an elementary student.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,200
Has that boy
come today ?

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,100
Yeah. He always
visits twice a week.

51
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,000
He's a very good brother,
thinking about his sister so much.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,700
That's right !
Boys like that are rare nowadays.

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,000
SUZUHARA

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Rei, are you
alright today ?

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Yes. Tomorrow, I will be with Dr. Akagi.
The day after tomorrow, school.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
How is school ?

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
I have no problems.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
I see. Very well, then.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Stand up.
Bow. Sit.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Oh, are Ayanami and
Aida absent again ?

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,200
Kensuke, how come ?

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,500
New Yokosuka. Following
battleships today as usual.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,100
I hear that something called
``Myoukou'' is in port.

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,200
Suzuhara !

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Y...ye...yes ?!

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,900
Take the printouts
to Ayanami later.

67
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes, sir !

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,300
Anyhow, the 1st Branch's
status is good !

69
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,500
No need ! Magi will confirm
the reconnaissance plane's data !

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,300
Vanished ?!
The 2nd Branch really vanished ?

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,900
Yes. It's confirmed.
It vanished.

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
This is bad.

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
The Administration and Inspection
Departments are in an uproar.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
The General Affairs
Department is in a panic.

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,000
And the cause...?

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
Still under investigation.

77
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,600
The only clue is
this satellite image.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Nothing else remains.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Juu byou...

80
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
...hachi...

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,500
...nana...

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,200
...roku...

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
...go...

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,100
...yon...

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
...san...

86
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,000
...ni...

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,900
...ichi...

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
TMZEB

89
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
How horrible !

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,300
Evangelion Unit 04, along with all installations within a 89km radius, have vanished.

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,000
Including thousands of people.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
From the time schedule...

93
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
...the accident apparently occured during the installation of the experimental ``S2'' engine.

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,500
Data is insufficient, but a possible cause might've been an error in the initial design.

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,300
The number of possible
combinations is 32,768.

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
There's a possibilty
of sabotage.

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,200
But it wasn't an explosion,
it was a disappearance.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,900
Probably swallowed by Dirac's Ocean,
just like Unit 01.

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,100
Then, the
``S2'' engine also...

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,500
Vanished...
Along with our dream.

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,200
It's because they forced us to use something we don't understand.

102
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,000
Eva's also such a thing.

103
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
So, how is Unit 03 ?

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,100
We're about to receive it. The U.S. administration didn't lose the 1st Branch.

105
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,900
They insisted on the right
to build Units 03 and 04.

106
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,400
But now they force us to accept it.
They're pushing their luck.

107
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,200
After that tragedy,
anyone could lose courage.

108
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,700
Will we do the activation test
using Rei's dummy plug ?

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll decide.

110
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,400
This is a
prototype dummy plug.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,700
Rei's personality was transferred, but the human mind and spirit can't be digitized.

112
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,700
This is nothing but
a fake, an imitation.

113
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,200
It mimics the pilot's thinking.
It's just a machine.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,000
It transmits a
signal pattern to Eva.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Eva believes that a pilot is present and synchronizes with it.

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,400
That's what we need.
Install the data in Units 01 and 02.

117
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,500
This still has
some problems.

118
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,200
It doesn't matter.
As long as Eva moves.

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Understood.

120
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,100
The transportation of the Unit is being left entirely to UN.

121
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,200
It will arrive this weekend.
Then you'll have work to do.

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Yes, sir. The adjustment and activation test will be done at Matsushiro.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
The test pilot...?

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The dummy plug is still dangerous.
One of the present candidates will be...

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
...appointed as the Fourth.

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,100
Yes, sir. There's one child whose
core will be ready immediately.

127
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I leave it to you.

128
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Rei, it's over.

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay.

131
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go eat.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,700
Okay.

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,900
Stand up. Bow.

134
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,700
Alright, it's time to eat !
It's the greatest pleasure in school life.

135
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
You didn't make
our lunches ?!

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,400
La...last night,
I was too busy doing homework...

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,300
And because of that, you're saying I have to go without lunch ?!

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,000
My, my. A quarrel
between husband and wife ?

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,700
NO WAY !

140
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,700
NO WAY !

141
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,100
What're you
so serious about ?

142
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,300
For Unit 03's activation test at Matsushiro,
we'll use the Fourth as the pilot.

143
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,100
The Fourth ?
The Fourth Child was found ?

144
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,600
Yesterday.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I haven't received a report
from the Marduk Institute yet.

146
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
The official documents
will arrive tomorrow.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Dr. Akagi, are you keeping
secrets from me again ?

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Of course not.

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,300
Well, alright.
And who is it ?

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Isn't there anyone else ?!

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,100
We had no choice. The candidates were collected in one place for their protection.

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,600
I don't know about this.

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
Asuka's okay.
She's proud to pilot the Eva.

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,800
Rei is Rei.

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,600
It's not good if it
concerns Eva and other matters.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,300
Shinji knows about
these matters best.

157
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,400
I don't want him to
experience any more pain.

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,800
But we need children like
them if we are to survive.

159
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,500
You're telling me,
``Don't avoid complications.''

160
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Bye !

161
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Suzuhara, you're on duty today.
Do your duty.

162
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
What're ya talkin' about ?

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,100
The printouts.

164
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,100
The teacher said
to deliver these.

165
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Oh, come on, Class Rep.
There must be someone else.

166
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
Ayanami's absent today.

167
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Ayanami and me ?
Then I have no choice.

168
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
But I can't go to a
woman's apartment alone.

169
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,400
Then I'll go with you...

170
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Shinji !~~You come
with me, okay ?!

171
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
Ayanami, I'm coming in.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It ain't good to enter
a woman's apartment uninvited.

173
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,500
We don't have a choice.
She won't notice if we put them here.

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,500
Excuse me.

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Oh, this's a woman's room ?

176
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Not very charming.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
Hey, don't touch anything,
she'll get angry.

178
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm only cleaning up.

179
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,500
I won't help you.
It's not a man's job.

180
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,000
Alright then.
But Misato hates guys like that.

181
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,000
I...I don't mind.
`Cause it's my policy.

182
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Man, quite a change.

183
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,100
What ?

184
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,400
You, Shinji.

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,700
When I first met you,
I thought you were a jerk.

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,300
You didn't seem like a guy who'd do things for the sake of others.

187
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,600
Anyhow, it's just
that you're quiet.

188
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
Sorry to disturb you.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,900
What ?

190
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Those are your printouts.

191
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,000
Sorry. I cleaned up on my own.
I didn't pick up anything but trash.

192
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,600
Th...thank you.

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,900
Well, I guess it's true that
all Eva pilots are strange.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,500
``Thank you.''
The word for gratitude.

195
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,400
The first time
I've used it.

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
I've never said
it to ``that'' person.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,300
NEON GENESIS

198
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,400
This city is a paradise
that humans built.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
Driven out of paradise...

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,700
...fleeing to that world on earth where humans live near death.

201
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Made by those
weakest of beings...

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,500
...made with wisdom acquired because of that weakness. A paradise of our own.

203
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:14,800
To protect us from the fear of death, to satisfy ourselves with joy, was made a paradise...

204
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,900
This city is
such a place.

205
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,700
Equipped with weapons
to protect ourselves.

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,200
A city for those cowardly people
fleeing a world full of enemies.

207
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,000
Cowardly people live longer.
That's one good thing.

208
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,100
Tokyo-3, NERV's camouflaged
intercept fortress city.

209
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,400
The long-delayed 7th construction
phase will be completed.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,600
How are you going to report Unit 04's
accident to the committee ?

211
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
Tell the truth.
The cause is unknown.

212
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,700
But there was great
damage this time.

213
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,300
I don't care about Unit 04
or the 2nd Branch.

214
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,800
We lost the ``S2'' engine sample,
and the remaining data is in Germany.

215
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,100
Unit 01 and this
installation are enough.

216
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,800
But the committee
is panicking.

217
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Naturally. It was
an unscheduled incident.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,300
Seele must be busy
revising the schedule.

219
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
Incidents missing from the
Dead Sea Scrolls may happen.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,500
It will teach those
old men a lesson.

221
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,000
The transformation of the 3rd Area and the prototype weapon test will...

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,400
Although the intercept system will finally be completed, no celebration is scheduled.

223
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,500
NERV is very strict.

224
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,700
That's the way
Commander Ikari is.

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,700
How about you ?

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,100
Are you sure about this, Kaji ?
I'll tell Katsuragi and Akagi.

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Before you say anything,
I'll cover your mouth.

228
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
How's business ?

229
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh, normal.

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Well, I have work to do.
Excuse me.

231
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,400
Although I don't say anything
about your private life...

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Please don't seduce young
girls during this emergency.

233
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,200
It isn't your job to enforce that.
And it's okay if it's you, Katsuragi.

234
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,900
That depends on the answer
you're about to give.

235
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,500
You must know the secrets of
the Marduk Institute and ADAM.

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Huh ?

237
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Don't play dumb
with me.

238
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,400
It's not like you to
ask someone for help.

239
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,300
I don't care what
people say about me.

240
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm not reserved
at the moment.

241
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,200
Coincidentally,
the Fourth Child was found.

242
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
What's the reason
for hiding that ?

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,100
I'll tell you one thing.

244
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
The Marduk Institute
does not exist.

245
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,700
There's nothing but NERV
pulling the strings.

246
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Nothing but NERV ?
Commander Ikari ?

247
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Code 7-0-7.
Investigate it.

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,400
7-0-7 ?

249
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Shinji's school ?

250
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,900
Misato.

251
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,600
What ?

252
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Ritsuko's expecting you at the meeting for tomorrow's business trip.

253
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,900
Alright, thanks.

254
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,500
We'll talk later.

255
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,400
Okay, okay.

256
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
How about having a
cup of tea with me ?

257
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm a guy.

258
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,700
I thought you'd
be more serious.

259
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,900
You'd say such things
to someone reliable, Ikari Shinji ?

260
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,400
Oh...s...sorry.

261
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,700
No, I'm sorry too. I didn't mean to say anything unpleasant.

262
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh yeah. I'll show you
something good.

263
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
Watermelon ?

264
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't you think it's cute ?
This is my hobby.

265
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't tell anyone.

266
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,000
Making or growing
something is good !

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
We see and learn many
things through that.

268
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,700
Also enjoyable.

269
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
Also painful.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Do you dislike pain ?

271
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
I don't like it.

272
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,500
Did you find
something enjoyable ?

273
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,900
That's good. Someone who
knows pain is kinder to others.

274
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
That's the opposite of weakness.

275
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,200
Yes, hello.

276
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
It's from Katsuragi.
A synchro-test will be held soon.

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,300
It's true. Shinji's synchro
ratio is getting worse.

278
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
What does it mean ?

279
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I can't say. But I suppose something happened during the last incident, something mental.

280
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's going to be even more difficult to tell him about Unit 03's pilot.

281
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,800
The person himself will be
officially notified tomorrow.

282
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,600
Stand up. Attention. Bow.

283
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Alright, it's
time ta eat !

284
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Suzuhara Touji of
second year, A Class.

285
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,100
Suzuhara Touji, come to the
Director's office immediately.

286
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
What the...?

287
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,900
Did you do something ?

288
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,600
Well, nothing I remember.

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Suzuhara Touji, entering.

290
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,100
You're Suzuhara Touji, right ?

291
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,600
How was your trip
to New Yokosuka yesterday ?

292
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,400
Absolutely great !~~By the way, I've obtained some disturbing information.

293
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,500
Eva Unit 03 ?

294
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Right. The one under construction in the U.S.~~I guess it's completed.

295
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
I have no idea.

296
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,700
I know you have to keep it secret, but please tell me.

297
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,500
I haven't heard anything.

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
Have you heard the rumor that the activation test...

299
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,800
...will be held at 2nd Experiment Installation in Matsushiro ?

300
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
I don't know.

301
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,700
Has the pilot
been chosen ?

302
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't know.

303
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,500
Misato could let
me pilot it.

304
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,400
Hey, Shinji, please ask her.
I really want to pilot Eva.

305
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Really, I don't know.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Then how about the rumor
about losing Unit 04 ?

307
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,600
What ?

308
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You really don't know ?

309
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,900
The 2nd Branch was destroyed.
My dad's section was going crazy.

310
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,100
Really ?

311
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,500
I guess.

312
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Misato hasn't
told me anything.

313
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,600
The pilot at the end of the
system has nothing to do with it.

314
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
If she didn't tell you,
I guess you don't need to know.

315
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,400
Sorry about asking
strange questions.

316
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,300
Anyway, Touji's pretty late.

317
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,100
We human beings survived the hell of the Second Impact, and rose up afterwards.

318
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,800
Currently, the birthrate
decreases every year.

319
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,300
Sorry for being late.

320
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,800
I heard.
Have a seat.

321
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, those younger generations
are torchbearers of the future...

322
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Hey, let's go home.

323
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Where's Touji ?

324
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
He'll be late
because he's on duty.

325
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,500
It's time to go home.
We strongly suggest...

326
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,600
Suzuhara.

327
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,300
You're on duty. You have to align desks and write the daily record.

328
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,400
I haven't had lunch yet.
When I'm finished, I will.

329
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Your lunch is always
from the school store.

330
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,300
Nobody cooks for me.

331
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,800
Suzuhara...

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,700
I have two sisters,
Kodama and Nozomi.

333
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,700
I always cook
lunch for them.

334
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,400
That's a lot of
work for you.

335
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, I'm quite good at cooking,
though you might not imagine it.

336
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,500
But I always have leftover
ingredients for the lunches.

337
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,100
What a waste.

338
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,200
I'll help you all I can with
the disposal of leftovers.

339
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, please.

340
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,500
Kaji.

341
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,400
Oh, Asuka. Sorry, I'm very busy.
Can you wait ?

342
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
But you have
time to see Misato.

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
Hey !
Not now !

344
