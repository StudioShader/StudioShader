16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,900
Are you ready, Shinji ?

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
Ah, yes.

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
Remove the final
safety lock !

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,700
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off !

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,900
Shinji, think only
of walking now.

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,200
Walking...

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
It's walking !

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,100
Walking...

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Shinji, come on !
Hurry, stand up quickly !

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,900
Shinji, calm down !
It's not your arm !

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,700
How's Eva's
defense system ?

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
The signal isn't working.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
The Field hasn't developed !

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not working ?!

30
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,200
Left arm damaged !

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
Circuits have snapped !

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Shinji, escape !

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,300
The front area of
the head is cracked !

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,800
The armor won't
stand any more.

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Head damaged.
Damage unidentified.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,500
The nerves for control are
snapping one after another.

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
No response from the pilot !

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Shinji !

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,700
An unknown ceiling...

40
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,000
EPISODE: 2
UNKNOWN
CEILINGS

41
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,700
The second coming of Angels...
It's too abrupt.

42
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,100
It's the same as 15 years ago.
A disaster always comes without notice.

43
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,300
In a way, it may be fortunate for us, because our prior investment didn't come to nothing...

44
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Things have never turned out yet.
If it's useless, it's a waste.

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,200
That's right.

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,300
About cleaning up the aftermath of the Angels, which are now public knowledge...

47
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:45,000
...and information control... Have Nerv handle both of them appropriately and smoothly.

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
Those matters are already
taken care of. Relax.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,300
The Government announcement regarding yesterday's special state emergency, states...

50
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,400
In this incident...

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
The UN forces in Japan...

52
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,900
The announcement was ``Scenario B-22.''
The facts were hushed up again.

53
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,600
The public relations department seems to be happy because they've got things to do at last.

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
They seem very optimistic.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Well...The truth is
that everyone is afraid.

56
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,100
Of course !

57
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,500
That's about it.

58
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,000
But, Ikari, can't you use
Nerv and Eva in better ways ?

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,100
The repair costs for Unit 00
and Unit 01 could ruin a country.

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,900
I heard that you gave
that toy to your son.

61
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,800
Humans, time and money...

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,700
How much must be spent by you and your son to satisfy you ?

63
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Moreover, you have another
job to do, don't you ?

64
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,100
The Human Complement Project,
that must have top priority.

65
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,300
That's right. That project is our only hope under such hopeless circumstances.

66
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,400
Anyway, although the Angels came again, the project can't be allowed to fall behind schedule.

67
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,200
As for the budgets,
we'll consider them.

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Well, the committee
will take over now.

69
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
Ikari, thanks.

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ikari, you can't turn back.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,500
I know.
Humanity has no time.

72
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,600
I always think an air conditioner's the greatest treasure of humanity ! A scientific success !

73
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
Shinji has recovered consciousness.

74
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,200
How is he ?

75
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,100
No external wounds.
His memory is somewhat confused.

76
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,300
It can't be...Is it
mental contamination...?

77
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I heard it's nothing
to worry about.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
Oh, really.

79
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
That's right, because
it was so sudden...

80
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,600
It's no wonder. A severe burden was imposed on his cranial nerves.

81
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,900
I think you mean M-I-N-D.

82
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,400
If Eva and this city are successful, we'll be able to win.

83
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
Will you defeat the Angels ?
You're as optimistic as ever.

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,000
Wishful thinking is a
necessity of human life.

85
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,800
Right. Your optimistic
character is encouraging.

86
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,200
'Bye.

87
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,700
Is it alright that
they live separately ?

88
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,100
For Ikari and his son,
it's natural to be without each other.

89
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,200
If anything, it's unusual
to live together...is it so...

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Alone ?

91
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, his room is located in
Block 6, over there. Any problems ?

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,900
No.

93
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,600
Are you satisfied
with it, Shinji ?

94
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,400
I prefer being alone.
All places are the same.

95
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,300
What ?!

96
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,200
As I said, I've decided to take charge of Shinji. I've got my superior's approval.

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Don't worry. I won't have
an affair with a child.

98
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,200
That goes without saying !
What the hell are you thinking ?!

99
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
As always, she can't
understand a joke.

100
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,500
Well, tonight we're going to do it flamboyantly, aren't we ?

101
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,200
What do you mean ?

102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,700
It's a welcome party for
a new lodger, of course !

103
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,900
Are you also
going to move ?

104
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,600
I'd never seriously thought that this city would really become a battlefield.

105
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,200
My husband told me that our children and I should move for safety at least.

106
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Move for safety... Even if this is a fortress city, we can't rely on anything at all.

107
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,400
Yesterday's incident...The mere recollection of it makes me shudder.

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Well, we're stopping
some place on the way.

109
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
Where are we going ?

110
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,700
It..is...a...good...place.

111
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,900
For some reason...this is a
lonesome city, isn't it ?

112
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,700
It's time.

113
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,500
Awesome !
The buildings are growing !

114
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:35,600
This is the fortress city for intercepting the Angels. ``Tokyo-3''... Our hometown...

115
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
...and the city
which you protected.

116
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,300
NEON GENESIS

117
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
I think your
things have arrived.

118
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Actually, I also just
recently moved to this town.

119
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,800
Come on in.

120
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,500
Um...May I come in ?

121
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Shinji, this is your house.

122
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,100
I...I'm back.

123
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,000
Welcome home.

124
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,300
Well, the place is a little untidy...
Hope you don't mind.

125
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,900
A...a little, she said...?

126
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,500
Oh, sorry. Could you put the food in the refrigerator ?

127
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,900
Ah, sure.

128
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,700
Ice...

129
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,600
Relishes...

130
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,400
And beer...

131
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
What kind of life
does she lead ?

132
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Well, the refrigerator
over there...

133
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,300
Ah, it's OK.
Perhaps...sleeping now.

134
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,700
Sleeping...?

135
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
Thanks for food !

136
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,600
Thanks for food.

137
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh my, what a life !
I just live for such times !

138
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,400
Ah, don't you like them ? They're rather tasty, even though they're instant.

139
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
No, but...I'm not
used to such a meal.

140
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,800
No, don't be fussy !

141
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Ah...no...ah,
I didn't mean that.

142
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Don't you think it's nice...

143
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
...having a meal with others ?

144
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Sure.

145
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Well. Next, here goes !

146
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Jan-ken-pon !

147
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,500
Pon !

148
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,400
Pon !

149
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,500
Pon !

150
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,400
Pon !

151
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
You were unlucky, Shinji.

152
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,800
As for the everyday duties which we've fairly decided, everything is A-OK.

153
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

154
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,100
Well, because this is now your house, you can really feel at home here.

155
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
Ah...yeah.

156
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Hey ! ``Yes, yeah, sure, okay''...
How gloomy !

157
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,300
You're a boy, aren't you ?
Pull yourself together !

158
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Okay.

159
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,000
It's okay. Take a bath and wash all the unpleasant things away.

160
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
Taking a bath
is life washing.

161
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,100
Mi...Mi...Mi...Misato !

162
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,800
What's wrong ?

163
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,700
Th...the...ther
...there's a...

164
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Oh, him ? A new kind of
hot spring penguin.

165
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,700
It's...

166
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,800
His name's Penpen.
He's another lodger.

167
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
By the way, you'd
better cover the front.

168
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Am I being a little too playful ?
I may be the one who's transparent.

169
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Katsuragi Misato...

170
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
She isn't a bad person.

171
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Taking a bath is
life washing.

172
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,700
But, in the bath, more unpleasant things come to my mind than others.

173
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,900
Father and Ayanami Rei...?

174
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,300
How was Rei ?

175
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,000
You went to the hospital this afternoon, didn't you ?

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,400
She'll be able
to move in 20 days.

177
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Meanwhile, I'll get the committee's agreement for Unit 00's restart.

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,200
What pain, they have...

179
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,600
There's no one else who can use Eva.
As long as they live, I let them do it.

180
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,800
No matter what
the children think...?

181
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,400
Yes. He had such a bitter experience.
I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Maintenance of ``him'' is
your job, isn't it ?

183
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm afraid I don't know how to get along with him.

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,800
Grumbling already ? You declared theatrically that you'd take charge of him, didn't you ?

185
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,600
Shut up !

186
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,400
I also regarded him as
my tool at that time.

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm the same as Ritsuko.
Although we defeated the Angel...

188
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,300
...I don't feel happy.

189
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
This is an
unknown ceiling, too.

190
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,200
It's only natural... I don't know any place in this city.

191
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
This is your home.

192
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,800
Why am I here ?

193
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,800
Head damaged !
Damage unidentified !

194
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,500
Trouble keeping
it activated !

195
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Status report !

196
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
Synchrograph has reversed.
Pulses are flowing backward !

197
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Cut the circuits !
Stop them !

198
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,800
We can't. The signal is refused.
It can't be received !

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,100
What about Shinji ?

200
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,300
No response from the monitoring system. We can't tell if he's alive !

201
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,200
Unit 01 is totally silent.

202
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Misato !

203
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,500
So much for this time...
Abort the operation !

204
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Pilot's protection is top priority !
Eject the plug by force !

205
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
Impossible.
It's totally out of control.

206
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,100
What ?!

207
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
Eva has restarted !

208
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
No way !
It can't move !

209
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,300
It can't be...

210
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Out of control.

211
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
He's won.

212
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,600
The AT-field...

213
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,300
It's no use. As long it
has the AT-field...

214
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,800
...Eva can't touch it.

215
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Left arm restored.

216
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,300
Unbelievable...

217
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,400
Unit 01 is also expanding an AT-field.
It's neutralizing the phase space.

218
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,800
No, it's eroding it.

219
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,000
That AT-field
was so easily...

220
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Self destruct ?!

221
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,000
The Eva...

222
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
That's Eva's...

223
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
...true potential...

224
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,800
The circuits
have been restored.

225
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
The system is operational.
The graph is in the normal position.

226
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Pilot's survival confirmed.

227
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Body Recovery Team, move it !

228
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
The pilot's recovery
is top priority.

229
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,000
Shinji, may I open the door ?

230
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:51,700
You did a praiseworthy thing today.
You should be proud of yourself.

231
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,800
Good night, Shinji.

232
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Hang in there.
