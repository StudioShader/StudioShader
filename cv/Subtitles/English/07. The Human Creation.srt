NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,000
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,400
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,500
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,300
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,700
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,100
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,200
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,400
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,800
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,600
Shine and hold up the sky.  Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
I owe you again.

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
But you won't
make up for it, right ?

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,500
As for the material which they demanded under the Freedom of Information Act...

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,300
...I dealt with them
using dummy information.

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,200
The administration's been preparing to amend the law, but that won't be possible.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,300
Do I have to do something
for that plan as well ?

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,300
No. Judging from your material,
that shouldn't be a problem.

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Then, I'll proceed
according to the script.

24

Episode: 7
A Human Work

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Good morning.

26
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,500
'morning.

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,400
My morning begins with THIS !

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Not with coffee ?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Traditionally, a Japanese style morning begins with rice, miso soup and sake, you know ?

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
But ``that'' is
your way, right ?

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
What do you mean ?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,300
Do you remember who's on duty for breakfast this morning ?

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,400
I can understand why you're
still single at your age.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Sorry that
I'm so uncouth.

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,100
And a slob, right ?

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,800
Shut up.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm done.

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
Are you really
coming to school today ?

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Of course. It's a parent teacher conference about your future plans.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
But, aren't you busy ?

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Don't worry.
It's part of my job.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
Your job ?

43
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Hi, thanks for coming.
Wait a minute.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Misato, don't come out looking
like that. It's embarrassing.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,700
Okay, okay.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,100
Good morning, Ikari !

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Hi Misato, we're off !

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,700
Take care.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Let's go !

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Ironic, huh ?

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,400
Well, it's a good sign that he's started to behave more cheerfully.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,600
Hello.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,000
He just left the house.
Guard him well.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Wow, she's here !

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Groovy woman !
Who is that ?

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Ikari's guardian.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,300
You mean, that beauty
takes care of him ?

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Idiots.

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Oh, man !
Misato's really fine !

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, really ?

61
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Moreover, she's the planning
manager of Nerv ! That's great !

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,200
Oh, really ?

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,400
Aren't we lucky, Kensuke...?
It's because Shinji's such a baby.

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Well, I'm sure
he's no match for us.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,900
Touji and the guys don't know anything about her uncouthness.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,800
If I had a
girlfriend like her...

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,500
...you'd have a hard life.

68
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,600
You don't
understand anything, ``sir.''

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,700
Alright, YOU take care
of peace on Earth.

70
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,300
Let US take care
of Misato, alright ?

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Unit 01 has cooled down.
Move on to the second stage.

72
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,800
Peace on Earth.
That's what Eva is for.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,900
What's Eva ? The entry plug smells like blood, but I feel relaxed for some reason.

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,000
After all,
I don't know anything.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,000
What about Unit 00's
biochest parts ?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
They're severely damaged.

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
We'll make it from scratch, but our supplemental budget's reaching its limit.

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I wonder if we can relax a little
once Unit 02 arrives from Germany.

79
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,900
It might be the other way around.
The disposal of the Angels isn't cheap, right ?

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Really, they're so
stingy with the budget.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
This place is supposed to be responsible for the future of humanity, right ?

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,900
It can't be helped. Eva isn't the only one we have to deal with.

83
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,100
In order for the survivors to live,
they need more money.

84
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,500
Budget...? Then, is the
Commander at a conference again ?

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Yes.
He's up in the air.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
His absence makes this
place quiet. Isn't that nice ?

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Excuse me. Would you
mind if I sit here ?

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,300
The spending amendment for
recovering a sample passed easily.

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,100
The Committee takes their
survival as top priority.

90
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,200
They'll spare no expense.

91
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,300
They thought the Angels
would never appear again.

92
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, I have more good news.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,900
All members of the Security Council, except the U.S., have approved the budget for Unit 06.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,000
It's just a matter of time until the U.S. approves it.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
That country has an
unemployment allergy, doesn't it ?

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
What about your country ?

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,300
We'll join in the production of Unit 08. The second installation plan is still valid.

98
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,300
The problem is, the pilot
hasn't been found yet.

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Angels have appeared again.

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,000
There's no other way, but that,
to defeat them.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,300
We don't want anything
like the Second Impact.

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,000
So, the Second Impact that evaporated Antarctica was...

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,300
Well, the history books explain it as a disaster caused by a massive meteor impact...

104
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,500
...but the truth
tends to be concealed.

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,900
15 years ago, mankind found the first humanoid creature called ``Angel'' in Antarctica.

106
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
During the investigation,
it exploded for unknown reasons.

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
That's what we called
the Second Impact.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Then, what we're doing is...

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,000
In order to avoid a possible third impact,
Nerv and the Evangelions exist.

110
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,900
By the way, the event will
be held tomorrow as planned.

111
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Alright.

112
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,400
Good morning.

113
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,500
G...good morning.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm going to
Old Tokyo on business.

115
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,700
I'll be late, so you'd
better order out.

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Later.

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
O...okay.

118
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,000
NEON GENESIS

119
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,700
ABANDONED AREA #28 (FORMER TOKYO METROPOLIS)

120
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,000
It's hard to imagine that this was once a flourishing metropolis.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We've arrived.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,100
There's no reason to do
this in a place like that.

123
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
Then, is the SSDF
involved in the project ?

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,900
The Strategic Self Defense Force ?
No, they weren't allowed.

125
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
That may be why they
can do what they want.

126
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Thank you for coming to our exhibition of Nippon Heavy Industry Solidarity.

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,500
You will observe the official demonstration from the control room.

128
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,200
Do you have any
questions before that ?

129
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,100
Yes.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh, you're the famous Dr. Akagi Ritsuko.
I'm very glad to see you here.

131
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,800
May I ask a question ?

132
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,100
Yes, absolutely.

133
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,500
According to the earlier explanation,
it's equipped with an internal engine.

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,900
Yes. That's a major feature of the unit.
150 days of continuous operation is assured.

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
However, for safety reasons,
I think it's too risky...

136
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,700
...to install a reactor in weapons for close range ground combat.

137
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I think it's much more useful than a weapon that doesn't work more than 5 minutes.

138
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,900
Remote control may cause a problem under emergency situations.

139
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,600
It's more humane than putting
a heavy workload on the pilot...

140
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
...which might result
in mental illness.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Stop.
It's childish.

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,700
Control by multiple personnel
might cause some problems.

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,800
It's safer than a dangerous
weapon that goes out of control.

144
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
A weapon without
control is nonsense.

145
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,800
It's just like a hysterical woman.
No one can deal with one.

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,600
That's what our technology
and pilots are for.

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you really think that science and the human mind can control that monster ?

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,300
Are you serious ?

149
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Yes.
Absolutely.

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Because you believe in unreliable things, like human minds...

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
...Nerv allowed that uncontrolled incident to happen.

152
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,100
As a result, the U.N. had to pass a big supplemental budget...

153
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,700
...although there's a country where 20,000 people are suffering from starvation.

154
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Despite the seriousness of that incident, the cause is still unknown.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,700
I want you to be
a little more responsible.

156
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,500
You're lucky. Nerv is exclusively protected by law, and you aren't held accountable.

157
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,600
No matter what you say, only our main weapon can defeat the enemy.

158
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,100
You mean the AT-field ?
It's only a matter of time.

159
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,700
Nerv's epoch won't last forever.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,900
Damn, those low-lifes...

161
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,600
That must be the revenge of those who failed to acquire concessions from Nerv !

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm so pissed...

163
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,200
Stop.
It's childish.

164
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,700
He wants to show off and wants to be praised. He's a small guy.

165
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,800
But how did they
know about the AT-field ?

166
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Top secret information
seems to be leaking.

167
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
What's the intelligence
section doing ?

168
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,600
Now, we'll begin
the demonstration of JA.

169
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,100
There's nothing
to worry about.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
Please watch from
the window there.

171
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Ready to start.

172
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,800
Start the test.

173
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,300
Start all engines.

174
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,900
Pressure, nominal.

175
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
Cooling system circulation,
nominal.

176
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,700
Extend the
control rods fully.

177
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,400
Engines have reached
the critical point.

178
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Power, nominal.

179
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,200
Start walking.

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,700
Walk ahead slowly.
Move right foot ahead.

181
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,200
Roger. Walk ahead slowly.
Move right foot ahead.

182
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Balance, normal.

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,800
Engines, nominal.

184
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
Roger. Next stage.
Move left foot ahead.

185
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,400
Check.

186
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
It's walking normally. It looks like it's worth being proud of.

187
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,000
What's happening ?

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,100
Something's wrong. The reactor's
internal pressure is increasing.

189
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,400
The temperature of the primary coolant is also coming up.

190
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
Release the valves !
Inject reactor coolant !

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,400
No good !
Pumping power won't come up !

192
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,400
No. Stop the engine.
Command an emergency stop.

193
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,700
Transmission of the
abort signal confirmed.

194
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
It's not accepting !

195
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,300
The communication
system's not working !

196
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
It's out of control !

197
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Impossible.

198
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,500
That robot's as rude
as the guy who made it.

199
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,800
There's a problem
in the compressor.

200
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,500
The control rods
aren't working.

201
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
At this rate, there's
a danger of meltdown.

202
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
I...can't believe this...

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,700
JA was programmed to react to
all possible emergency situations.

204
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
This shouldn't be happening.

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,800
But right now, we're facing
the danger of a meltdown.

206
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Under the present conditions, there's nothing to do but wait until it stops by itself.

207
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
How likely is
it to stop ?

208
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,300
0.00002%.
It'll take a miracle.

209
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,000
We'd better do something other than wait for a miracle. Tell me how to stop it.

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
We've tried everything.

211
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,100
No. There must be a
way to reset everything.

212
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
Tell me the
password to do it.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,300
The deletion program is confidential.
It's not my decision.

214
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,700
I don't have
the authority.

215
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
Then get
the authority...

216
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,300
...right now !

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,500
It's me. Connect me to Mr. Manda at Tokyo-2.
Yes, the Minister of Home Affairs.

218
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,700
Oh, concerning that matter,
Mr. Yasugi will deal with it. Ask him.

219
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,800
That's too serious to allow with a verbal order.
You need written authority.

220
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,800
Then, we have to ask Mr. Yoshizawa
for permission, is that right ?

221
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Yes, I've received permission from Mr. Witz.
Yes. Alright. Later then.

222
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,300
No one wants to
make the decision.

223
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,500
The order will be given soon.
The operation will be official.

224
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,900
We can't wait for that !
It'll be too late once it explodes !

225
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,900
The ``Jet Alone'' is
heading towards Atsugi.

226
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,200
There's no time. I'll do it on my own authority. Excuse me.

227
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Hey, Hyuuga ? I've already talked to the people in Atsugi...

228
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,800
...so send Shinji and
Unit 01 in F configuration.

229
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Yes, it's an emergency.

230
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,800
It's impossible.
Stop this, Capt. Katsuragi.

231
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,300
How are you
going to stop it ?

232
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
With human hands, directly.

233
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Are you serious ?

234
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,500
But, the interior will be full of radiation. It's too dangerous.

236
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,200
If I succeed,
everyone'll be safe.

237
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,700
When the control signal from here is off,
you can open the hatch manually.

238
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,600
You can enter
through the backpack.

239
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,900
``Hope...''

240
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,500
It's the password
to delete the program.

241
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,400
Thank you.

242
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,700
The target is JA. There's a danger of meltdown in 5 minutes.

243
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,100
So, we can't allow it to get
close to the residential area.

244
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,900
Hyuuga ?!

245
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,600
Yes ?

246
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,700
After launching Eva, get out of here.
Climb to a safe altitude.

247
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,300
Roger !

248
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,100
Shinji.

249
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,800
Yes ?

250
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Run with the target,
and put me on its back.

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,200
After that, do your
best to stop the target.

252
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,100
Are you going to
get inside it ?

253
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,800
Yep.

254
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
That's crazy !

255
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I know it's crazy.
But there's no other way.

256
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,900
It's too dangerous.

257
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,000
No problem. Eva can withstand a possible explosion.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,700
I didn't mean that !
I mean you...

259
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Well, I have to do what I can.
Otherwise, I'll regret it.

260
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,300
Target sighted.

261
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Let's go.

262
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,600
Eva in dropping position.

263
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
Docking out !

264
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,200
Roger !

265
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,900
I caught up !

266
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,100
Less than 4 minutes left.
Put me on it !

267
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,700
It's alright. Do it !

268
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Misato !

269
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,900
Be careful.

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
Man, it's hot !
This's bad.

271
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,100
Stop, damn you !

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Misato, hurry !

273
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,000
Here it is.

274
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,200
``Hope''

275
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Error ?
How come ?

276
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,600
No doubt.
The program has been altered.

277
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,100
Power reactor,
0.2 to the critical point !

278
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,200
Control rods
are malfunctioning !

279
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,700
It's sink or swim...

280
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,900
Misato, escape !

281
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,400
Move ! You bastard !

282
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Misato !

283
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,800
0.1 to the critical point !

284
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,700
It's no use,
it's gonna explode !

285
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,500
Is this the end...?

286
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
MISATO !

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,100
She did it !

288
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,000
Internal pressure, down !

289
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
All normal !

290
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
We're saved !
She did it !

291
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,100
She did it ! She did it !
She did it !

292
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
That idiot.

293
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,900
Misato, are you alright ?
Misato ?

294
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,400
Yeah, but this really sucks...

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm glad that you're safe.
I'm so glad !

296
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,200
It's great. I underestimated you !
The miracle happened !

297
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes.

298
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,200
That ``miracle'' was already
prepared by somebody.

299
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,100
Recovery of Unit 01 completed.
There's no danger of radiation.

300
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,600
Except for the act of Capt. Katsuragi,
everything went according to the script.

301
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,700
Well done.

302
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,100
`morning...

303
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,100
Now, it's shower time...

304
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,900
Where are my
bra and panties ?

305
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,200
Good morning, Ikari !

306
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,300
Good morning. I am off !

307
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,200
Take care.

308
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,100
Misato is really nice.

309
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,600
I thought so before, but she's so embarrassing at home.

310
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,600
She's uncouth, bad-looking, and a slob.

311
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,900
It's embarrassing
to see her.

312
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,600
I envy you.

313
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
How come ?

314
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Ikari is really a baby.

315
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,500
Really.

316
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
How come ?

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,700
You get to see the true side of her that she doesn't allow us to see.

318
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,400
That's very much
like a family.
