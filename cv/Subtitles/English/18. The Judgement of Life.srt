00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,650
Hey, where's Asuka ?

17
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,650
She's already gone.
She's trying to avoid me.

18
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,150
Why ?

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,250
Shin-chan, it seems women's hearts are still too hard for you to understand.

20
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,450
Umm...

21
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,450
By the way...

22
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,650
Go ahead.

23
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,250
Is the rumor about
Unit 04 being lost true ?

24
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,950
I heard it was
destroyed in an accident.

25
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,850
Yes, it's true. Unit 04's gone,
along with NERV 2nd Branch.

26
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,350
It was during the
``S2'' engine test.

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,550
We're alright here, though.
All three units are working fine.

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,950
The pilots and staff
are both excellent, too.

29
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,950
But I heard Unit 03
is coming from the U.S...

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,150
The activation test will take
place at Matsushiro, right ?

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,950
Yeah. I'll be gone about 4 days. But don't worry, Kaji will take care of you guys.

32
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,250
But what about the test ?

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,350
Since Ritsuko will be there,
there won't be any problems.

34
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,050
But what about the pilot ?

35
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,150
Well, about the pilot...

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,050
Coming !

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,150
Good morning, ma'am !

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,650
I came here today to make
a request of Major Katsuragi.

39
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,950
Please, make me the pilot
of Evangelion Unit 03.

THE~~~~~~~~~~~~~
JUDGEMENT
~~~~~~~~OF LIFE

42
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,650
Shinji doesn't know yet ?

43
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,450
I just can't find the
right time to tell him.

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,150
I'm afraid to, since I can't figure out what he's thinking.

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,250
Come on, you're the one who wanted to be his guardian.

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,250
Yeah, I know...

47
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,050
So, when will the
pilot be called ?

48
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,350
Tomorrow, since there are
preparations to be made.

49
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,650
He may talk
about it himself.

50
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,250
Not likely. He wasn't happy
enough to brag about it.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,950
His only condition was the transfer of his little sister to HQ's medical unit.

52
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,150
Misato's really mean.

53
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,950
I'm the most willing, so why don't they use me as backup ?

54
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,650
Right, Touji ?

55
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,250
Huh ?
Oh, right.

56
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,850
What's wrong ?~~You left home before me, but you're late.

57
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,650
What, no marital
quarrel today ?

58
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,550
I just didn't want to see your faces, you Three Stooges !

59
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,450
Now for lunch.

60
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,450
Hey, where's Touji ?

61
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,950
I haven't seen
him anywhere.

62
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,950
He left without eating lunch ?
That's not possible.

63
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,550
He's been acting
weird lately.

64
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,050
Suzuhara...

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,250
Huh ?

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,850
Oh, it's you, Ayanami.

67
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,550
If you're looking for Shinji,
he ain't here.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,150
You know about me ?
Souryu seems to know too.

69
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,150
Yes.

70
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,150
Shinji's the only
one who doesn't know.

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,950
It's really unusual for
you to worry about others.

72
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,950
Really ?
I don't understand.

73
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,350
You're worried about Shinji.

74
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,350
Really...?
Maybe that's true.

75
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,150
Yep.

76
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,450
Hikari !
Let's eat !

77
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,350
Two hours late already,
and he's here at last.

78
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,150
He's the first guy to
make me wait this long.

79
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,850
When you were dating you just left without waiting, right ?

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,050
Therefore, it was the incident
known as the Second Impact.

81
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,350
I was living in Nebukawa
at the time, but now...

82
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,950
...it's underwater because Antarctica's icecap melted and the waters rose.

83
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:08,850
Sorry, transferee. But I had to hit you. I couldn't be satisfied unless I hit you.

84
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,850
I'm sorry, Asuka.
You usually walk home with Ikari.

85
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,950
Don't worry, I'm only
with Shinji as a duty...

86
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,850
...and I'm not in a mood
to see his face right now.

87
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,350
It's about Suzuhara, right ?

88
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,050
Yes. Can you tell ?

89
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,350
It's so easy to see.
Only the Three Stooges can't see.

90
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,950
But, Ikari seems so naive.

91
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,950
He's the dullest. An idiot. He doesn't know how to get along with others.

92
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,250
I see.

93
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,750
Ayanami might be
the girl Suzuhara likes.

94
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,450
Suzuhara likes the
teacher's pet ?!

95
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,750
They were getting
along well during lunch.

96
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,350
Don't worry, Hikari.

97
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,650
That girl knows how to get along with people 1/10000th as well as Shinji.

98
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,850
Really ?

99
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,950
Really !

100
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,450
May I ask
a question ?

101
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,450
What ?

102
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,850
Why do you like that
hotheaded idiot ?

103
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,450
He's kind.

104
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,850
Oh, then making up with
you was a mistake !

105
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
Don't tell me that now...

106
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,250
By the way...

107
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,450
Kaji sure takes a
long time to bathe.

108
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,650
Who'll pilot Unit 03 ?

109
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,150
What ?
You haven't heard yet ?

110
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,250
Who is it ?

111
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,050
I don't know.

112
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,250
Great bath.

113
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,150
Bickering again ?

114
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,550
I can't believe it.

115
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,450
Are you two like this
whenever Katsuragi's gone ?

116
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,950
No !~~I want to smile prettily since you're staying with me tonight.

117
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,650
But not today.
I can't smile !

118
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,850
I understand.
Let's get some sleep.

119
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,950
Hitting the hay is the best
solution in situations like this.

120
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,050
Are you asleep yet, Kaji ?

121
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,550
No, not yet.

122
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,050
What kind of person
is my father ?

123
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,050
Well, I'm surprised
by that question.

124
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,550
I thought you were going
to ask about Katsuragi.

125
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,650
It seems like you're
always with him.

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,050
The Deputy Commander is the one who's with him all the time.

127
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,650
Have you been asking around
about your father ?

128
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,750
I wasn't with him
for a long time...

129
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,850
So, you don't know.

130
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,050
But I've started to understand many things about my father recently.

131
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,350
About his job,
about my mother. So...

132
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,850
You're wrong. You just
think you understand.

133
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:16,150
Well, that's why people try to know each other. You never learn everything about them.

134
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:24,450
Well, that's why life's
so interesting.

135
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,550
Does that fit your
relationship with Misato, too ?

136
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,250
For us, women exist
on the opposite shore.

137
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,950
There's a river wider and deeper than the ocean between men and women.

138
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,050
I can't understand grownups.

139
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,150
Unit 03 activation test:
T minus 30 minutes.

Above ground facility

143
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,850
Primary power,

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,950
Apotheosis No.2,

145
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,650
Refrigeration systems in all
sections functioning at standard levels.

146
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,450

Data link to
Evangelion Unit 03 established.

151
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,050
It's possible to use
this in combat now.

152
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,750
Oh, how nice.

153
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,050
You don't sound
very enthusiastic.

154
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,150
When this unit is delivered
it will be under your direct command.

155
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,750
Exclusive possession of four Evas...
If we wanted to, we could end the world.

156
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,150
Did you tell Shinji ?

157
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,150
After the test.

158
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,050
Fourth Child has arrived. Squad 2, begin entry preparations immediately.

159
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,750
He hasn't
come yet, Asuka.

160
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,350
He may not
come today.

161
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,150
I thought he
would eat today.

162
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Do you want it ?

163
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,350
Unit 03 should be
in Japan now, right ?

164
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,050
Yes. I think
it arrived yesterday.

165
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,550
I'm so jealous.
Who's gonna ride it ?

166
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,850
Touji, maybe ?
He's absent today.

167
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,750
No way.

168
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,550
Entry plug secured.
Begin phase one connection.

169
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,350
Transmitting pulses.
Graph display within norms.

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,850
Roger. Transfer the
operation to phase two.

172
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,950
Full nerve link established.
List clear through 2-5-5-0.

173
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,350
Harmonics all reading standard.
Approaching absolute threshold.

174
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,550
Abort the test.
Cut the circuits.

175
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,850
No good !~~There's a huge power surge coming from inside the unit !

176
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,550
Can it be...

177
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,650
...an Angel ?

178
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,350
NEON GENESIS

179
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,450
An explosion at Matsushiro.

180
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,650
Status unknown.

181
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,050
Send a rescue team and 3rd Squad. Take care of everything before the JSDF arrives.

182
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,950
Roger.

183
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,450
Unidentified object
moving at the site.

184
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,350
Pattern orange.
Can't be identified as an Angel.

185
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,650
First class combat alert.

186
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,050
First class combat alert !

187
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,750
Prepare for ground combat !

188
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,150
All Evas to go and take position at the counterattack point.

189
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,650
Air transportation is
planned to start in 20.

190
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,150
An accident at Matsushiro ?

191
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,450
Oh, no...What about
Misato and the others ?

192
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,850
There's no contact yet.

193
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,150
Oh, no.
What should I do ?

194
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,650
What're you whining about ?!
We can't do anything but worry now !

195
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,050
But we have to go against
the Angel on our own...

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,250
Commander Ikari is
taking direct command.

197
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,150
My father is...?

198
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,550
We have the visual from Nobeyama.
Visual on the main screen.

199
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
Just as we thought.

200
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,550
Transmit the terminal signal. Execute forced ejection of the entry plug.

201
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,850
Impossible. It won't recognize either the terminal signal or the ejection code.

202
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,150
What about the pilot ?

203
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,850
We have his respiration
and pulse, however...

204
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,450
From this moment, Evangelion Unit 03 is expendable...

205
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,350
...and the target is identified
as the 13th angel.

206
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,850
B...but, sir.

207
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,850
Draw the line at Nobeyama as planned,
and destroy the target.

208
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,750
Target approaching.

209
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,550
All units, stand by
for ground battle.

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,350
No way. An Angel ?
You mean that's an Angel ?

211
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,950
Yes.
That's the target.

212
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,050
The target ?
That's...an Eva.

213
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,850
I can't believe it.
Taken over by an Angel ?

214
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,150
Is it piloted by a kid,
just like ours ?

215
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,050
Don't you know yet ?
Unit 03's pilot is...

216
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,150
Asuka ?

217
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,550
Asuka !

218
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,550
Eva Unit 02, down !

219
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,850
Pilot has ejected.
Salvage crew on the way.

220
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,150
Target is moving
toward Unit 00.

221
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,250
Rei, avoid close combat and stop the target. I'll send Unit 01 soon.

222
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,150
Roger.

223
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,250
``He's'' inside.

224
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,950
The Angel's invading
Unit 00's left arm.

225
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,150
The nerve joint
is being invaded.

226
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,150
Sever the
left arm, hurry.

227
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,650
But that'll cut
the nerve connection.

228
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,750
Sever it now.

229
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,450
Yes, sir.

230
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,450
Moderate damage to Unit 00.
Pilot has been injured.

231
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,650
No...

232
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,350
The target is approaching. Contact within 20. Take care of it.

233
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,750
You're saying
it's the target...

234
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,950
But isn't there
someone in there ?

235
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,650
A kid my age.

236
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,350
An entry plug.
There is someone inside.

237
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,250
Trouble with life support.

238
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,950
The pilot's in danger.

239
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,450
This isn't good.
Cut synchronization to 60% !

240
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,350
Wait.

241
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,250
But if you maintain this status,
the pilot will die.

242
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,450
Shinji, why don't
you fight ?

243
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,850
But there's a
person inside, Father.

244
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,150
It doesn't matter.
It's an Angel. Our Enemy.

245
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,750
But I can't do that. I have to save the pilot. I can't kill another person.

246
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,150
You'll die.

247
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,250
I don't care. It's better
than killing someone.

248
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,250
Very well, cut the synchronization of the pilot and Unit 01 completely.

249
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,250
Cut it off, sir ?

250
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,350
Yes. Switch the circuit
to the dummy plug.

251
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,550
But sir, the dummy system still has many problems, and without Dr. Akagi's direction...

252
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,750
It'll work better
than the pilot. Do it.

253
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,750
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,350
What the...?

255
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,650
What'd you do, Father ?!

256
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,250
Signal reception comfirmed.

257
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,650
Control system switched.

258
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,550
All nerves now connected
to the dummy system.

259
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,650
32.8% of the emotional factor
is unclear. Unable to monitor.

260
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,150
It doesn't matter.
Release the system. Commence attack.

261
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,950
Is this the power
of the dummy plug ?

262
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
All systems normal.

263
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,750
More increase in gain.

264
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,750
Stop !

265
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,150
Father, stop !
Please stop doing this !

266
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,250
Damn !

267
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,650
Stop !

268
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,250
Stop !

269
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,250
Stop !

270
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,250
Stop !~~~

271
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,150
Stop !

272
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,350
Stop !

273
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,350
Stop !

274
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,150
STOP !

275
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,250
E...Eva Unit 03...

276
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,550
...I mean,
target completely silenced.

277
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,950
This looks good.
Kodama, Nozomi and me.

278
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,450
Lunch for four.
Will he eat tomorrow  ?

279
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,950
Over here ! A survivor !
BQR, get the medics, hurry !

280
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,650
Yes, that recorder's graphs...
Get rid of it.

281
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,150
I'm alive...

282
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,050
Kaji...?

283
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,950
You were lucky, Katsuragi.

284
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,450
How's Ritsuko ?

285
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,650
Don't worry.

286
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,150
Her condition's
better than yours.

287
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,350
I see.
What about Eva Unit 03 ?

288
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,450
It was handled as
an Angel by Unit 01.

289
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,650
I...I haven't told
Shinji anything yet.

290
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,250
Shinji...

291
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,450
Misato, you're alright.

292
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:21,250
I...I'm sorry. I had to tell you something important, but...

293
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,950
Misato, I've...I've...

294
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,550
My father...
I begged him not to...

295
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,350
Shinji, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,450
Report from the
entry plug salvage crew.

297
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,950
Survival of the
pilot confirmed.

298
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,450
Still alive.

299
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,550
Roger. Cut the deformed
part with a laser.

300
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,150
Send altered LCL
sample to the
lab as a priority.

301
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,950
Cut trapped biological parts.
Prepare for cauterization.

302
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,850
Unit 03's pilot is...

303
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,950
The Fourth Child is...

304
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,950
Touji ?

305
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,550
Shinji ?

306
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,950
Shinji ?

307
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,450
Shinji ?

308
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,450
Shinji ?

309
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,750
Shinji ?!
