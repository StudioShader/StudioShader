1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,070
I guess we'll be in Japan by tomorrow.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,900
Misato said she'd pick us up around noon.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,990
Misato is the person who was
with me in Germany before you.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,390
I don't really like her that much,
she seems too contrived.

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,450
Tsk, I guess that means a temporary
parting between us.  Boooring!

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,200
You'll have plenty of boyfriends
when we get to Japan.

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,850
I hear the Third Children is a boy.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,900
I'm not interested in some stupid kid!

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,340
I'm only interested in Kaji-san.

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm honored.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,990
I'm ready anytime for you!
Be it kissing and beyond!

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,020
You're still a child.  Those things
are for when you get older.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,670
What?!  Boooring!
I'm old enough already!

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,690
I'm an adult!  An adult!
An adult!!  So look at me!!

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,210
Fiction becomes reality.

16
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,270
What a fate.  The experimenter
herself was the guinea pig.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,150
So, you think that the contact
experiment was the immediate cause?

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,200
The mental breakdown...
Was that a result of the contact?

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,110
It's too cruel.  She committed suicide,
leaving behind such a young girl.

20
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,850
Hmm, perhaps.  I don't think
that it was the only cause.

21
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,880
Asuka-chan, Mama
cooked your favorite for you.

22
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,200
If you complain about what you like
and dislike, that girl will laugh at you.

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,190
Everyday, she's like that.

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,200
She talks to the doll, thinking
that it's her beloved daughter.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
She might feel responsible,
in her own way.

26
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,030
She devoted her whole life to research,
and did not spend the time to take
care of her own daughter.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,570
I sympathize with your grief.

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,190
But, they are like a doll
mother and a doll daughter.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,100
Maybe there is very little difference
between humans and dolls.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,260
Dolls are made by humans in their own image.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,480
If God really exists, we
might just be dolls for him.

32
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,760
Hearing such things, I can hardly believe
you're a doctor of modern medicine.

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,890
Yes, I'm a doctor, but I'm
still a human, and a woman first.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,400
You're so good, Asuka-chan.
You may cry if you wish.

35
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,410
It's OK.  I won't cry.
I can think for myself.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,620
Can you hear me, Asuka?  Your synchro
ratio decreased by 8 whole points.

37
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,640
Don't think about extraneous things.
Just the same as usual.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,730
I'm trying!

39
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,650
Don't Be

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,160
Recently, Asuka's synchro ratio has
been getting lower and lower.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,990
This is very troubling.
We don't have a spare.

42
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,710
Maybe we should work on Rei's Unit 00 first.

43
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,460
We can't repair both of them at the same time.

44
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,900
The mitosis process in the left arm of
Unit 02 has cleared the numerical goal.

45
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,420
The necrosis process is presently under 0.05%.

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,790
No problems in the apotheosis process.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,460
Maintain the current status of the
self formation system of Unit 00.

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,440
Connect each receptor to
the second signal terminal.

49
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,470
<i>What was born from Adam, the Eva series.</i>

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,760
<i>We have no other way to defeat
the Angels, besides utilizing the
very cause of Second Impact.</i>

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:57,770
<i>In other words, those who utilize even
the thing that tried to destroy them,
those are human beings.</i>

52
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,500
After all, I probably hate Eva.  Probably,
I'm trying to avenge my father.

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,900
Katsuragi-san!

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,820
They have begun construction
of Evas up to Unit 13?

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,680
In seven places all over the world?

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,460
This information came via Shanghai.
The source is reliable.

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,780
Why are they speeding up construction now?

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,900
We've lost two Eva units recently, and
now another two units are severely damaged.

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,860
I suppose they're speeding the creation
of a spare force for backup plans.

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,950
Who knows?  We've even received
parts from Germany which were originally
made for Units 05 and 06.

61
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,250
Nowadays they're spending
a great deal of money.

62
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,720
The budget was recently doubled.

63
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,900
From that, we might guess that the
executives were driven into a corner.

64
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,900
I feel the committee's impatience.

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,680
So, do you think they are doing it because they
anticipate cases of several Angels attacking at
once, and not just one like we've seen so far?

66
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,520
Maybe...  But there's no reason for them
to do that outside of the normal channels.

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,980
There might be another reason.

68
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,860
The number you have just
dialed is no longer in service.

69
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,760
Strange...  It won't connect.

70
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,850
I wonder if he's gone off somewhere again?

71
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,030
A train will be arriving soon on track number 2.

72
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,680
Please stay inside the white line until
the train has come to a complete stop.

73
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:32,220
He spent an entire month dissolved inside
Eva and he's already back to his old ways.

74
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,080
After all, I lost...  and to the likes of you.

75
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,970
It's been a long time since we were all together,
so what's with this unsociable atmosphere?

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,930
I'm finished.

77
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,020
Asuka!

78
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm not going to get it!  After all, maybe
it's a call from Kaji-san to Misato.

79
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,680
You should get it.

80
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,350
It can't be...

81
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,330
Oh, I'm so sorry that I forced the unrivaled
Shinji to do such a trivial job.

82
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,860
Yes, hello...

83
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,810
Hmph!  I can't stand the way he's so formal.

84
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,830
An international call from Germany for Asuka.

85
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,160
It's your mother.

86
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,550
For me?  From Mama?

87
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,400
Give me that!

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,670
Hallo, Mutter!

89
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,290
Wir haben uns lange nicht gehoert.

90
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,950
Danke schoen...
ch...

91
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,200
<i>Listening to her speaking an unfamiliar
language, I feel as if Asuka were a stranger.</i>

92
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,150
Ach, ha, niemals!

93
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,930
Er ist ein sauberer Mensch.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Ja.  Ja.  Wirklich?

95
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,740
Das ist aber toll.  Fantastisch!

96
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,010
Mother...

97
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
this is just a guess at what she is saying:

98
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
Auch, wenn ich gehts keine lerne.
go.

99
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
here's what I know for sure:

100
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
Auch, wenn ich...

101
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,400
Ich werde jetzt ins Bett gehen.

102
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,340
Aufwiederhoeren.  Gute Nacht!

103
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,640
That was a very long call.

104
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,700
It's only a sort of periodic communication.

105
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm envious.  Family talk...

106
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,210
Oh, it looks...  It's only superficial.
She isn't my real mother.

107
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,360
But, it doesn't mean I dislike her.

108
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,090
It's just that I feel a little uncomfortable with her.

109
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,740
Why the hell am I telling you such a thing?!

110
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,510
Sorry.

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,960
It's the end for me, when
I get sympathy from you!

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,270
I feel sick...

113
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,000
Who wants to bathe in the same water that
Misato and stupid Shinji have bathed in?

114
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,370
Who wants to use a washing
machine that Misato and stupid Shinji
have washed their underwear in?

115
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,320
Who wants to sit on a toilet that
Misato and stupid Shinji have used?

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,080
Who wants to breathe the same
air as Misato and stupid Shinji?

117
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,470
I hate Misato!  I hate Shinji!

118
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,600
I hate First even more!

119
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,660
I hate Papa!  I hate Mama!

120
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,630
But most of all I hate myself!!

121
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,830
I can't take it anymore!!

122
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,110
Why me?!  Why me?!!

123
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,420
Synchro graph, minus 12.8.  It's on
the borderline of the starting indicator.

124
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,180
What a terrible state!  Her
results are worse than yesterday.

125
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,970
Asuka is feeling bad today.  She's
in the second day of her period.

126
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,240
Synchro ratio is not affected
by external bodily disorders.

127
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,240
The problem's in her subconscious.

128
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,870
<i>We may have to change the Unit 02 pilot.</i>

129
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,120
Asuka, you're all done.

130
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,010
Maintenance of power system number 8
is going to start at 18:00 this evening.

131
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,190
Asuka's pride was badly damaged.

132
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,200
It's natural, after being beaten that way.

133
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,990
The regular meeting on the first Command
Center project will be held on time.

134
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,100
More ever, it's much worse that she
feels that she was beaten by Shinji.

135
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,190
Personnel of the General Affairs department
report to meeting room number 2.

136
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,890
Maybe it's our limitations.  I'm afraid
the three of us couldn't live together.

137
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,980
You broke through the critical point?
Is this the end of your nice family game?

138
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,670
I won't listen to this from someone who
conceals her loneliness with pet cats.

139
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,190
Sorry, I'm just a little upset.

140
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,430
Why do I have to go through such
an awful time just because I'm a girl?

141
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,580
I don't even want to have children.

142
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,550
Circular route number 7 is now
closed because of an accident.

143
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,950
Please use route number 12 instead.

144
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,760
If you don't open your mind
to her, Eva will not move.

145
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,200
You mean I'm closing myself off?  Me?

146
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes.  Eva has her own mind.

147
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,420
That doll?

148
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,320
You must be aware of that.

149
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,450
Today is a special day, since even you talked
to me.  Tomorrow maybe we'll have snow.

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,020
Damn!  Are you that happy
that I can't pilot Eva?

151
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,330
Don't worry.  When an Angel comes,
the invincible Shinji will defeat it.
We don't have to do anything.

152
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,040
They only need Shinji!  If Shinji is
there, everything will be OK!

153
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,110
Not only Shinji, but a doll like you is sympathizing
with me.  It must be the end for me.

154
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,370
I'm not a doll.

155
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,180
Shut up!  You do anything you're ordered to.

156
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,980
You'll kill yourself if Commander
Ikari orders you to do so.

157
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,840
Yes, I will.

158
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,160
You're a doll, just like I thought!

159
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,730
You've always looked like a doll, and
I've hated you for a long, long time.

160
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,870
Everyone!  I hate everyone!

161
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,250
Shinji is absent today, too.

162
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,270
Ayanami's absent, as usual, but...

163
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,810
Asuka too.

164
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,580
Suzuhara is still in the hospital.

165
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,490
I guess that the situation is very
serious, and they can't come to school.

166
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,490
All Eva Unit 02's signals are normal.

167
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,920
Connection and fusion of VA is within normal limits.

168
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,790
The field of proliferation is within the expected range.

169
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,450
So you're finally back together...
after losing like that.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,200
You're just my doll.  So move like
I tell you to, and don't say 'no'.

171
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,070
Why does a weapon have a mind?
What a hassle!

172
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,150
Anyway, you must only say 'yes' to my orders.

173
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,030
This is stupid.

174
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,120
All personnel, level one combat
readiness.  Prepare for aerial assault.

175
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,960
An Angel!  They're still coming?

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,530
Visual confirmation of the Angel.
This is at maximum zoom.

177
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,430
It's not moving from orbit.

178
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,790
It's maintaining a constant distance from us.

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,120
That means it's waiting for a chance
to come down.  Or is it going to
destroy us without approaching?

180
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,310
We can't get at it easily.

181
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,230
Anyway, we can't do anything unless
it moves to within our firing range.

182
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,730
Eva can't defeat an enemy in orbit.

183
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,450
How's Rei?

184
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,060
She and Unit 00 are in good condition.
They'll be OK.

185
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,100
Roger.  Unit 00, move out!  Prepare
for extreme long distance firing.

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,630
Unit 02, Asuka, be ready for a sortie as backup.

187
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,520
Backup?  Me?  For Unit 00?

188
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,580
That's right.  Take the rear guard.

189
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,120
You must be kidding?  Eva Unit 02, move out.

190
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,600
Asuka!

191
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,030
It's OK.  Allow her in the front if she wishes.

192
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Major Kasturagi!

193
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,070
You mean, if Asuka fails
here, she'll be dismissed.

194
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,860
That means, it's her last chance?

195
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,240
We must prepare in case the
Unit 02 pilot has to be changed.

196
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,270
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,790
By the way, aren't you sending out Unit 01?

198
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,800
It's been frozen by strict
orders from Commander Ikari.

199
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,540
<i>We have to accept it after an accident like that...</i>

200
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,020
If I fail this mission, I might lose
my position as pilot of Unit 02.

201
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,810
You must not make any mistakes, Asuka.

202
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,350
Target is still out of the firing range.

203
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,590
Oh, hurry up and come here, you lazy Angel!
You're laziness is getting on my nerves.

204
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,050
Alert

205
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,860
Alert

206
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,850
The enemy's directional weapon?

207
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,530
No, no thermal energy reaction detected.

208
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,690
Abnormal patterns in the psycho graph.
Mental contamination will start soon.

209
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,730
An Angel's psychic attack?  Can they
understand the minds of human beings?

210
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
God damn it!

211
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,690
Positrons diminished.

212
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,500
No effect.  It's out of range.

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,530
Unit 02 has no ammunition in its rifle.

214
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
What's the result of the ray analysis?

215
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,690
Energy wave of visible wavelength.

216
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,820
It's similar to an AT Field, but
the details are still unknown.

217
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,890
How's Asuka?

218
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,650
Situation dangerous.  Mental
contamination has broken the borderline.

219
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,340
Nnnooo!  I...  Don't enter into me!

220
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,510
No

221
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:15,580
Pain

222
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:15,670
Strangled

223
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:21,720
No

224
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:21,820
Don't touch me!

225
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:21,880
Hatred

226
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:26,710
No

227
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:26,810
Stop!

228
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:26,890
Menarche

229
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:31,680
No

230
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:31,750
Keep out!

231
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:31,860
Shame

232
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,320
No

233
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,380
No!

234
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,510
Commit
double
suicide

235
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,390
No!

236
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:38,790
No

237
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,900
Death Sex

238
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:38,990
Invader

239
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,920
No!

240
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,030
No

241
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,110
Mama

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,190
How comfortable

243
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,180
No!

244
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,920
Don't peep into my mind!

245
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,090
Please!  Don't invade my mind anymore!

246
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,620
Asuka!

247
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,990
Her psycho graph is at the critical point!

248
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,460
Her mental circuit is now
being severely damaged.

249
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,540
Further overload will be too dangerous.

250
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,650
Asuka, retreat!

251
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,490
No!

252
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,760
This is an order!  Asuka, I order you to retreat.

253
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,150
No, never!  I'd rather die here than retreat!

254
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,980
Asuka...

255
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,220
Accelerator, start synchronization.

256
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,780
Voltage increasing.  Approaching the pressure range.

257
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,210
Compulsory focusing start.

258
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,580
Correct the error from the rotation
and gravity of the Earth, 0.03.

259
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,570
Pressure in the barrel is at maximum.

260
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,730
Release the final safety lock.

261
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,340
All personnel, prepare for firing!

262
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,660
No effect!  There's not enough energy to break
through the AT Field from this great a distance.

263
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,080
But, output power is at maximum.
We can't get more power!

264
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,350
Unit 02's psycho graph signal is very weak.

265
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,240
How about the mind barrier from the LCL?

266
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,310
No effect.  We can't even
expect the buffering effect.

267
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,820
Give first priority to life support.
Don't allow feedback from Eva.

268
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,350
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,360
<i>That ray seems to scan Asuka's
mental wavelength pattern.</i>

270
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,050
<i>Oh, no...  Does that mean the Angel
is trying to search the human mind?</i>

271
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,490
Why am I crying?

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,620
I decided that I wouldn't cry anymore.

273
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,670
What is it, Asuka?

274
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,360
It's a present from your new mama.

275
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,670
Don't you like it?

276
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,780
No.

277
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
So, what do you want?

278
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,350
I'm not a baby.  I'll become an
adult earlier than other people.

279
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't need a teddy bear.

280
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:27,820
Painful

281
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,300
Look at me.

282
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,100
Stepmother

283
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,460
The loss

284
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:28,730
Painful

285
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:28,990
Insanity

286
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,280
Mama, please don't stop being my mama.

287
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,220
No

288
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,280
Sex

289
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:30,400
Death

290
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:30,460
No

291
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,550
Sex

292
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:31,610
No

293
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:31,730
Death

294
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:31,790
No

295
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:31,880
Sex

296
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,970
Death

297
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,700
Please, come to heaven with me.

298
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,000
No

299
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,090
No

300
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,160
No

301
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,250
Sex

302
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,320
No

303
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,320
Mama, Mama, please, don't kill me!

304
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,390
Death

305
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,470
Sex

306
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:34,560
Death

307
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:34,620
Sex

308
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,740
Death

309
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:35,760
No

310
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:35,830
Sex

311
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:35,940
Death

312
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,010
No

313
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,090
Sex

314
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,140
Sex

315
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,230
Death

316
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,290
Sex

317
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,390
Death

318
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,470
Sex

319
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,970
No!  I'm not Mama's doll.

320
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,500
No

321
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:38,580
No

322
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:38,680
No

323
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:38,760
Sex

324
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:38,830
No

325
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:39,880
No

326
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,980
Death

327
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,070
No

328
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,250
I'll think for myself, and I'll live on my own.

329
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,130
Sex

330
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,220
Death

331
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,270
No

332
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,340
No

333
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,430
No

334
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,520
No

335
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:41,600
No

336
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,100
I don't need Papa or Mama.
I will live on my own.

337
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,340
No!  Don't make me remember such things!

338
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,960
I want to forget, so don't dig into my memories!

339
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,400
I don't want to remember such terrible things.
Stop!  Stop!!

340
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,740
My dear Asuka-chan...

341
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,970
Die with me.

342
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,550
OK, I'll die with you Mama.

343
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,480
So don't stop being my mama!
Please, Mama!!

344
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,100
Mama?

345
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,120
I don't know you.

346
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,910
Who are you?

347
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,330
My name's Soryu Asuka Langley.
Pleased to meet you.

348
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,780
Are you stupid?

349
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,600
Chance.

350
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,560
So look at me!

351
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,710
No!  This isn't me!

352
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,790
My name's Soryu Asuka Langley.
Pleased to meet you.

353
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,330
Are you stupid?

354
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,230
Chance.

355
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,920
So look at me!

356
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,320
No!  This isn't me!

357
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,580
My name's Soryu Asuka Langley.
Pleased to meet you.

358
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,070
Are you stupid?

359
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,740
Chance.

360
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,650
So look at me!

361
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,100
No!  This isn't me!

362
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,680
My name's Soryu Asuka Langley.
Pleased to meet you.

363
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,360
Are you stupid?

364
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,000
Chance.

365
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
So look at me!

366
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,570
No!  This isn't me!

367
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,120
My name's Soryu Asuka Langley.
Pleased to meet you.

368
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,820
Are you stupid?

369
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,490
Chance.

370
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,510
So look at me!

371
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
No!  This isn't me!

372
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,480
Help me!  Help me Kaji-san!!

373
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,300
You're still a child, Asuka.

374
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,280
What are you doing there?!

375
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,580
You won't do anything!  You won't help me!

376
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,730
You won't even hold me!

377
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,920
Nobody.  Nobody!  Nobody!!

378
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,790
So look at me!

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,030
Are you lonely?

380
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,570
Are you lonely?

381
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,250
No!  Don't come near me!

382
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,490
I can live by myself!

383
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,000
Are you stupid?

384
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,780
Do you like me?

385
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,650
I don't need anyone!

386
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,640
Do you really like me?

387
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,830
I can live by myself!

388
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,070
Liar.

389
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:45,830
Rejection

390
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,770
NNOOOOO!!!

391
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:45,920
Father

392
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,010
Mother

393
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,070
Lack

394
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,190
Anxiety

395
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,250
Separation

396
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,340
Evasion

397
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,410
Contact

398
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:46,520
Obsession

399
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:46,580
Attachment behavior

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,670
Dependence

401
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:46,760
Emptiness

402
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:46,850
Mental Collapse

403
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:46,910
Pity

404
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,000
I am not a doll!

405
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,090
Mental contamination

406
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,190
Don't violate me!

407
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,250
Stop!

408
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,340
Die with me!

409
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,410
No!!

410
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:47,520
It hurts!!

411
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:47,580
I hate you!!

412
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:47,670
Presumptuousness

413
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:47,760
Latency

414
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:47,850
Masculine protest

415
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:47,910
Don't be

416
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,000
Manifest

417
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,090
Reaction formation

418
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,180
Shadow

419
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,240
Opposing will

420
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:48,360
Compensation

421
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,420
Don't be

422
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,510
Primary identification

423
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,570
Don't be

424
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:48,690
Rationalization

425
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:48,750
Oblivion

426
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:48,840
Deception

427
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,910
Raison d'etre

428
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,020
Self-confidence

429
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,080
Infantile experience

430
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,170
Sense of loss

431
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,260
Compensation

432
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,360
Symbiosis

433
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,420
Hostility

434
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,510
Repression

435
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:49,580
Death

436
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,690
Death

437
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:49,750
I hate you!!

438
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,400
My mind has been sullied.

439
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,290
Kaji-san, it's polluted.

440
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,120
What should I do?  My mind has been polluted.

441
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,350
All activity has ceased in Unit 02.

442
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,660
A problem has arisen
in the life support system.

443
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,810
The pilot will enter the danger zone.

444
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,380
No change in the target.  Relative
distance still shows no change.

445
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,110
The possibility that the target will move
into the firing range of Unit 00 is 0.02%.

446
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,430
Can we transport Unit 00 by air?
Shoot the target from the sky?

447
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,320
No, we can't do that.  If the Angel shoots
during the approach, we can't protect it.

448
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,440
I'll go out in Unit 01.

449
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,320
No.  This target is one which
invades the minds of the pilots.

450
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,450
We must avoid a situation
where Unit 01 is invaded now.

451
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,750
So, you mean it's OK as
long as I'm not defeated?

452
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,570
That can't be guaranteed.

453
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,550
But, if this goes on, Asuka will...

454
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,890
I don't care.  Rei, descend to
Dogma and use the Lance.

455
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,860
Lance of Longinus?  Ikari, that's...

456
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,790
We have no other choice to destroy
a target in orbit, where an AT Field
from here can't reach.  Hurry!

457
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,630
But, there's the possibility that the
contact between Adam and Eva
will cause Third Impact.

458
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,020
It's too dangerous.
Commander Ikari, please don't do it!

459
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,620
<i>It's a lie?  Second Impact wasn't
caused by contact with an Angel.</i>

460
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,640
Open area numbers 10 to 15 of Central Dogma.

461
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,480
Unit 00 has passed the 6th Malebolge.

462
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,130
Next, open area numbers 16 to 20.

463
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,490
<i>You say Third Impact will not be
aroused by such a small thing.</i>

464
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,310
<i>So, what was the real
cause of Second Impact?</i>

465
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,450
Ikari, I think it's too early to use that.

466
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,280
The committee has started the
mass production of the Eva series.

467
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,290
This is our chance, Fuyutsuki.

468
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,180
But, I can't...

469
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,340
We can't make the clock move backwards.

470
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,520
But, we can make it move
forward with our own hands.

471
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,520
The old men will not allow it.

472
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,940
We must put an end to everything
before Seele takes action.

473
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,730
It's not a good idea to lose Unit 02 right now.

474
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,540
But, if we use the Lance of Longinus
without the permission of Seele,
that will cause many problems.

475
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,800
If a reason exists, that is enough.
I don't see anything else to consider.

476
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,580
Reason?  What you really want is an excuse.

477
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,720
The amplitude of the EEG of
Unit 02's pilot has decreased to 0.06.

478
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,510
It's the critical point for life support.

479
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,050
Unit 00 has passed area number 2.
She'll be coming up above ground.

480
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,830
That's the Lange of Longinus.

481
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,640
Unit 00, take position for throwing.

482
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,890
Confirm the target.  Correct for error, OK.

483
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,300
Start the countdown.

484
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,420
10 seconds left...

485
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,230
8...

486
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,290
7...

487
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,460
6...

488
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,570
5...

489
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:09,920
4...

490
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,110
3...

491
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,270
2...

492
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,510
1...

493
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,260
0...

494
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,740
Target annihilated.

495
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,750
Eva Unit 02 is free.

496
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,380
How about the Lance of Longinus?

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,450
It surpassed escape velocity.
It's now moving into a Lunar orbit.

498
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,980
It'll be almost impossible to recover it.

499
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,080
Yes.  There is currently no way
to retrieve that much mass.

500
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,810
Unit 02 is all right.  Graphs
are within normal limits.

501
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,590
Send the unit to cage number 2.

502
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,960
Use route number 67.

503
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:11,920
How's Asuka?

504
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,810
Confirmed.  The pilot is alive.

505
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,150
Quarantine for contamination complete.

506
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,680
I see...

507
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,930
I'm glad you're OK, Asuka.

508
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,480
Shut up!  Who are you calling OK?!

509
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,780
It's the worst.  I was rescued by that girl!

510
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,540
Rescued by that damn girl!

511
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,590
I would rather die than that!

512
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,300
I hate, hate, everyone, everything!!

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Unit 00 is possessed and corroded by an Angel.

520
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,800
In order to protect Shinji from the Angel,

521
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Rei wishes herself dead.

522
