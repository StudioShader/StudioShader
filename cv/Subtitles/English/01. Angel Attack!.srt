4
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Like a cruel angel...

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,500
...young boy, become a legend.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,900
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:38,000
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Lost while searching for something soft...

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,200
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,600
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,700
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,900
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,300
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

14
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,100
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

A.D. 2015

16
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Today at 12:30, a special state
of emergency has been declared...

17
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,600
...throughout the Kanto and Chubu
districts around the Tokai Area.

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,500
Please take refuge in
your designated shelter.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,600
I repeat: Today at 12:30,
a special state of emergency...

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,100
How could I miss him now, of all times ?!
What am I gonna do ?

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,600
All normal lines are down due to the special state of emergency.

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
No good.

23
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I knew I shouldn't
have come.

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,800
I may not be
able to meet her.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Look here !!

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,500
Oh, well. Guess I'll
go to the shelter.

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,400
The unidentified object
is still approaching.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,500
We've got a visual image of the target.
I'll transfer it to the main screen.

29
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,300
It's been 15 years.

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes, it has.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,600
Angels....

32
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,300
EPISODE 1:
ANGEL ATTACK

33
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
All missiles hit the target !

34
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,100
Sorry to keep you waiting !

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,700
The target is still intact.
As before, it's moving toward Tokyo-3.

36
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,400
Our airforce
can't stop it.

37
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,400
Total war ! Mobilize all divisions at Atsugi and Iruma bases !

38
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,500
Don't hold back !
Smash the target at all costs !

39
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
How ?! It must've
been a direct hit !

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,400
The tank battalion was totally destroyed. Guided missiles and artillery have no effect...

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,500
It's hopeless ! We'll get nowhere with such poor firepower !

42
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,700
It's protected by an
AT-field, as we expected.

43
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,900
Yes, normal weapons have
no effect on Angels.

44
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,600
Understood. I'll employ that,
as previously arranged.

45
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
Whoa, it can't be !

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
They're gonna
use an N2-mine ?!

47
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Get down !

48
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,400
We did it !

49
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,600
Sorry, but there's
nothing left for you to do.

50
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,600
Incoming shock wave !

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,700
Are you all right ?

52
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,500
Yes, but something in
my mouth is crunchy.

53
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,000
That's fine.
Are you ready ?

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Here goes !

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Thanks for your help !

56
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,300
Er, it was my pleasure,
Miss Katsuragi...

57
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,800
You can call me Misato.

58
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Nice to meet you,
Ikari Shinji.

59
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Same here.

60
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Target status ?

61
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
We can't see
it due to EMP effects.

62
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,600
It was such a massive explosion.
It's must've been destroyed.

63
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Sensors on line.

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Energy reaction in the
center of the explosion !

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
WHAAAT ?!

66
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,500
Visual image restored.

67
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,700
That was our trump card...

68
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Unbelievable...

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Damn monster !

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,700
Sure.
Don't worry.

71
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,500
His protection is my top priority. Prepare a car train for us; a linear one, please.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,700
Yes, I'll take full responsibility for him, since it was my idea to meet him. Bye.

73
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,600
But this sucks !~~I just had this car restored, and now it's a wreck.

74
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,100
33 loan repayments to go...
and the repair costs....

75
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Um, Misato....

76
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,700
Even worse, my only good clothes have been ruined....

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,700
Um, Misato....

78
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Eh, what ?

79
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,600
Is it okay that
you did that ?

80
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
Ah, it's okay, no problem.
It's an emergency.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,300
We can't do anything
if the car doesn't run.

82
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,600
In addition, even if I don't look like it, I'm an international officer. So it's okay.

83
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
That doesn't seem like
a very good excuse.

84
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Boring boy ! You look so calm, despite your pretty face.

85
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You think so...?

86
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,400
Hmm, are you angry ?

87
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,700
Sorry, sorry.
It's natural because you're a boy.

88
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,600
You're childish for
your age, aren't you ?

89
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,100
It's regenerating,
as we expected.

90
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,400
Otherwise, it would be useless
as an independent weapon.

91
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, impressive. It can also
enhance its own functions.

92
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
In addition, it has
acquired intelligence.

93
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,700
It's only a matter of
time until the next attack.

94
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,700
The gate is closing. Attention, please. The train is about to depart.

95
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,400
The special agency, Nerv ?

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes, a special organization directly attached to the United Nations.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
It's the one my
father belongs to, isn't it ?

98
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,700
Well, yeah...do you
know what he does ?

99
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,600
My teacher told me it's an important job to protect the human race.

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,700
You're now the commander of this operation. We'll see how you deal with it.

101
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
Yes, sir.

102
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,900
Ikari, considering our
available weapons...

103
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,600
...I have to admit we have no effective way to deal with the target.

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,500
Are you confident
you can defeat it ?

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,900
That is why
Nerv exists.

106
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,600
We expect much from you.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,300
The target remains unchanged.

108
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,500
The present effective rate
of interception is 7.5%.

109
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,500
The U.N. troops can't help it.
What are you going to do ?

110
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll activate Unit 01.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,500
Unit 01 ?
But we don't have a pilot.

112
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,700
No problem. A back-up
pilot will arrive shortly.

113
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,500
Are we going to
where my father is ?

114
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Well, yeah...we are.

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,500
Father....

116
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
By the way, were you given
an I.D. by your father ?

117
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh, yes.

118
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,300
Here it is.

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,600
Thanks !

120
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,700
Then, read this.

121
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,600
``Welcome to

122
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Nerv...

123
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,700
It's about my father's work.
Is there anything for me to do ?

124
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I can't say I'm surprised. He never writes me, unless he wants me to do something.

125
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
I see. You consider
him a tough customer.

126
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,400
I feel the same.

127
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,600
Awesome !

128
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,500
A real Geo-Front !

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,400
That's right. This is
Nerv's secret headquarters.

130
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
It's also the foundation for rebuilding the world for the human race.

131
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
NEON GENESIS

132
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,500
This's strange. I'm sure
this was the right way....

133
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,100
I'd really rather not
wear a skirt in this place !

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Anyway, where has Ritsuko gone ? Sorry, but I'm not familiar with this place.

135
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
We passed here
some time ago.

136
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,600
But it'll be okay !
All systems exist to be used.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,700
Chief of Project E, Section 1
of the Technical Department...

138
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,600
...Dr. Akagi Ritsuko,
Dr. Akagi Ritsuko.

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,900
Please contact Capt Katsuragi Misato at Section 1 of the Operations Dept. immediately.

140
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,500
I don't believe it !
She must've gotten lost again.

141
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Umm...Hi, Ritsuko...

142
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,600
What are you doing, Captain Katsuragi ?
We're short of hands and time !

143
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
Sorry.

144
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Is he the one ?

145
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes, according to Marduk's report, he's the ``Third Child.''

146
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,700
Nice to meet you.

147
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Ah, the same.

148
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,500
He's very much like his father...
neither one is lovable.

149
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Well, I'll leave
the rest to you.

150
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,400
This will be their first
meeting in three years.

151
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Sub-Commander, the target has begun to move again.

152
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay !
All hands to battle stations !

153
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Repeat: All hands to battle stations.
Prepare to intercept the enemy on the ground.

154
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,700
Hear that ?

155
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,400
That's serious.

156
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,700
By the way,
how is Unit 01 ?

157
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,800
It's configured with Type-B equipment.
It's being cooled.

158
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Does it really work ?
I heard that it hasn't worked yet.

159
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,600
The possibility of it working is 0.000000001%.
O9-system seems like a good name for it.

160
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You mean it
won't work, don't you ?

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,200
How rude !
It isn't zero.

162
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,600
It's only a number. Anyway, to say ``it doesn't work at all'' will be no excuse.

163
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,900
It's pitch black.

164
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
A face...
A gigantic robot...

165
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,500
You won't find
this in the manual.

166
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,700
This is humanity's Multi-Purpose Humanoid Fighting Machine, EVANGELION.

167
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:47,100
This is Unit 01. It was built in secrecy. This is mankind's last chance.

168
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Is this also Father's work ?

169
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
That's right !

170
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,500
Been a while, hasn't it ?

171
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Father....

172
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Move out.

173
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Move out ?!
Unit 00 is frozen.

174
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,100
You don't mean that
you're activating Unit 01 ?

175
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
We have no choice.

176
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,300
Hey ! We can't
have Rei pilot it !

177
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,900
We have no pilots !

178
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
One has just arrived.

179
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Are you serious ?

180
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,300
Ikari Shinji...

181
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
...you will pilot it.

182
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,500
Yes ?

183
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,800
But it took Ayanami Rei seven months to synchronize with Eva !

184
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,600
He just arrived.
It's impossible.

185
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Just take a seat. We don't expect you to do any more than that.

186
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
But....

187
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
At present, intercepting the Angel's attack is our top priority.

188
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,400
Even if there is little potential of synchronizing with Eva.

189
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,700
We have no choice.
Do you understand, Captain Katsuragi ?

190
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,500
You may be right....

191
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,400
Father, why did
you call me ?

192
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,600
For exactly the
reason you think.

193
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Do you mean that I should pilot this, and fight against that thing I saw ?

194
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,100
Of course.

195
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,600
No way ! Why're you saying this now ?!
I thought you didn't want me !

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,400
I only called you
because I need you now.

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,300
Why me...?

198
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,500
Because others can't....

199
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,700
I can't do it ! I've neither seen
nor heard of it !~~How can I do it ?

200
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,000
Listen to her explanation.

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,400
No...I can't !
It's impossible !

202
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,500
If you're getting in, stop wasting time. Otherwise, go home !

203
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
That bastard has found us.

204
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Shinji, there's no time.

205
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Please get in.

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,700
No way ! After coming
all this way, it's ridiculous.

207
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,400
Shinji...Why did
you come here ?

208
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't run away from your father,
or above that, from yourself.

209
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,700
I know.
But I don't think I can do it !!

210
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,500
Fuyutsuki.

211
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Wake up Rei.

212
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Is she available ?

213
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Well, she isn't dead.

214
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,500
I understand.

215
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Rei.

216
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Yes.

217
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
The back-up turned out to be useless. Try again.

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

219
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Reconfigure Unit 01's
systems for Rei ! Restart !

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,700
Yes, ma'am. I'll stop the current process and restart it.

221
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
As I thought,
I'm unnecessary.

222
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,700
Watch out !

223
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Eva moved !
What happened ?!

224
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
It tore off the binding
attached to its right arm !

225
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Impossible ! The entry plug hasn't even been inserted yet ! It can't move !

226
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,200
It reacted without
the interface...

227
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Or rather,
did it protect him ?

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
He can do it !

229
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,700
Don't run away. Don't run away. Don't run away. Don't run away. Don't run away....

230
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,200
I'll do it !
I'll pilot it !

231
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,100
Cooling process complete.

232
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
The binding of the
right arm has been fixed.

233
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,600
Position setting for
docking in the cage is okay.

234
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
The stop signal plug
has been discharged.

235
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,500
Roger.
Insert the entry plug.

236
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
Plug, locked in place.

237
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,900
Begin the first connection.

238
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
Inject LCL
into entry plug.

239
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
What's this stuff ?!

240
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,400
Don't worry. After your lungs fill with LCL, it'll directly supply you with oxygen.

241
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
You'll get used
to it soon.

242
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,200
I feel sick.

243
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Live with it !
You're a boy, aren't you ?!

244
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,400
Connect the
main power supply.

245
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
Transmit power
to all circuits.

246
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Yes, sir.

247
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
The second contact
is beginning.

248
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,400
The connection of the
A10-nerve is operational.

249
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,100
Set Japanese as
command interface.

250
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,700
All initial contacts
are all right.

251
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
Connect the mutual lines.

252
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,500
Rate of synchronization is 41.3%.

253
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,400
Incredible !

254
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,500
All harmonic values are normal.
Everything is under control.

255
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,600
It'll work !

256
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,500
PREPARE FOR LAUNCH !

257
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,500
Prepare for launch !

258
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,400
Release the
first lock bolt !

259
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Released.

260
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,400
Move the umbilical bridge !

261
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Release the
second lock bolt !

262
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,700
Remove the first binding,
and then the second.

263
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Cancel first through
fifteenth safety locks.

264
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,100
Internal battery charged.

265
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
Socket for external
power supply is operational.

266
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Roger. Eva Unit 01
to the launch pad.

267
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,700
The course is clear.
All green !

268
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
It's ready to launch.

269
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Roger. Are you
sure about this ?

270
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,500
Of course. We have no future
unless we defeat the Angels.

271
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,700
Ikari, are you
really sure about this ?

272
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Launch !

273
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,400
