The Value of a Miracle is...

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,100
Thanks for letting
us stay, Shinji.

21
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,200
Where's Misato ?

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,900
She might still be sleeping.
She's had a lot of overnight work lately.

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,800
Yeah, her job's
very hard.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Keep quiet,
so we don't wake her up.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Hey, what're you
guys doing here ?!

26
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,500
Getting out
of the rain.

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,700
Oh, sure. You're after me,
aren't you ?

28
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm changing clothes.
If you peek, I'll kill you.

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,700
You bitch ! Who'd want to
see you changing clothes ?!

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,300
She's too conceited.

31
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,100
I...I...I...

32
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,300
Sorry for disturbing you.

33
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,900
I'm glad to see you.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,100
Welcome home, Shinji. We have a harmonics test tonight. Don't be late.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Okay.

36
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,800
Asuka, you know that,
don't you ?

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah.

38
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,000
Congratulations
on your promotion.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Co...Congratulations.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,100
Thanks.

41
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, don't mention it.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, I'm off.

43
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,700
Take care.

44
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,300
What's wrong ?
Did something happen to Misato ?

45
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,000
Her badge.
It has two lines.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
She must've been
promoted to Major.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,900
I didn't notice.

48
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,100
I wonder when...

49
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,500
Are you serious ?
How pathetic.

50
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,700
Don't you guys
have any sympathy ?

51
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not so easy for a woman her age to take care of two junior high students.

52
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,800
``We'' are the only ones
who have human hearts.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Number 0 and 2 have reached the contamination border, that's the limit.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Number 1 seems to be able to take it.
Decrease the plug depth by 0.3.

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
It's almost reached
the contamination zone.

56
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,300
But these readings...?
He's incredible.

57
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,800
His harmonics and synchronization
ratios are approaching Asuka's.

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,100
It's his talent, isn't it ?

59
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,600
He was definitely
born to pilot the Eva.

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Although he doesn't wish to be like that.
He wouldn't be happy to know that.

61
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Well done, everyone.

62
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Shinji, good job.

63
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,000
What do you mean ?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Your harmonics value has risen 8 points from the previous test. Nice increase.

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
But it's still 50 points
lower than mine.

66
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
An 8 point gain in ten days.
That's great.

67
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,300
Not that great.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,600
How nice it is for
you to be praised.

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm going home.
You idiot.

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,800
Ummm...congratulations
on your promotion.

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
Thank you.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,100
But, to tell the truth,
I'm not that happy.

73
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,600
I understand.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,800
When I was praised,
I wasn't so happy either.

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,200
It only made
Asuka angry.

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I wonder why
she got angry ?

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,400
What made her angry ?

78
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Does it bother you ?

79
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's because you always
consider what others think.

81
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,600
Congratulations !

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you.
Thank you, Suzuhara.

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,500
No, no. He's the
one who planned this.

84
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,200
Yes, the planning and scheduling were done by Aida Kensuke, Aida Kensuke !

85
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you, Aida.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Oh, you don't need to thank me for it.
This is what comes naturally.

87
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,900
But, why is the
Class Rep here ?

88
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,400
I invited her.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Right ?

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Right ?

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
What about Rei ?

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,900
I invited her, but she doesn't seem to get along well with others.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Kaji's late.

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,300
Is he cool ?

95
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,500
He sure is. Kaji's completely different from these lumps of potato, like day and night.

96
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
It's an insulting comparison.

97
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,400
What did you say ?!

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
Is it still difficult for you to be in situations like this ?

99
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,700
No, but I'm not used to
being around so many people.

100
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,100
Why're we making
such a fuss ?

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Promotion...It's because your work is recognized by others, right ?

102
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,100
Well, probably.

103
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,700
That's why we're celebrating.
But you don't look happy.

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,400
No, I don't mean that I'm totally unhappy. I'm a little happy.

105
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
But, that's not
why I'm here.

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,300
Then, why'd
you join Nerv ?

107
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, it's been a long time.
I've forgotten.

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
It must be Kaji !

109
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,200
I came directly from HQ.
I met her on the way.

110
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
I doubt that.

111
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,200
Jealous ?

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,300
Absolutely not.

113
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,500
Anyhow, congratulations, Major Katsuragi.
I have to be polite to you from now on.

114
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100
What're you talking about,
you idiot ?

115
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Well, it's unprecedented that both the Commander and Sub-Commander left Japan.

116
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,900
That means they
trust Katsuragi.

117
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
My father's gone ?

118
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
Commander Ikari is at
the South Pole by now.

119
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,700
No lifeforms may exist in this dead world of Antarctica.

120
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,600
Or rather, we should
call it ``Hell.''

121
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Nevertheless, we humans are
standing here as living beings.

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
Because we're protected
by the power of science.

123
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
Science is humanity's power.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,500
That arrogance caused the tragedy 15 years ago. The Second Impact.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
And this is the result...

126
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,100
This punishment is too great,
considering our crime.

127
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
It's like
the Dead Sea.

128
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,000
Yet, this is a pure world without the impurity of the original sin.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,400
I prefer a world where people live,
no matter how smeared with sin it is.

130
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,100
Message received.

131
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,700
Nerv reports that they detected an Angel in orbit above the Indian Ocean.

132
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
It suddenly appeared
two minutes ago.

133
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,900
Move the 6th reconnaissance
satellite to its orbit.

134
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Two minutes to contact.

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,800
Target in sight.

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Incredible.

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,300
That's ridiculous.

138
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,600
The 6th satellite's going
to contact the target.

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
Start scanning.

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
Start transmitting data.

141
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,600
Transmission confirmed.

142
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
AT-field ?

143
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
That's a new
way to use it.

144
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,800
What massive power of destruction.
That's definitely an AT-field.

145
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,600
It's using momentum.

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,700
That Angel itself is
something like a bomber.

147
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
Anyway, the first shot hit the
Pacific Ocean far from its target.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
The second shot hit that
point two hours later.

149
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,400
After that, it's steadily correcting the trajectory errors.

150
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,600
That means
it's learning.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,100
N2 anti-air missiles
didn't have any effect.

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,000
The Angel disappeared
after that.

153
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,500
It'll come.

154
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
Next time, it might drop
itself right here.

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,800
Could that be the birth
of the 3rd Ashinoko Lake ?

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,600
Fuji's five lakes will merge and become part of the Pacific Ocean, including HQ.

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,300
What about Commander Ikari ?

158
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,900
Communications are impossible due to the Angel's strong jamming.

159
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,700
What's Magi's recommendation ?

160
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
They ALL
recommended evacuation.

161
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,700
What're you going to do ?
You're in charge now.

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,800
Report to each ministry.

163
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Issue special declaration
D-17 under Nerv's authority...

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,500
...and evacuate all citizens
within a 50km radius.

165
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Recommend the backup
of Magi to Matsushiro.

166
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Are we going to
abandon this place ?

167
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,200
No. But we don't
want to risk all of us.

168
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,800
Special declaration D-17
was announced by the government.

169
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,900
All citizens, go to your
designated shelters immediately.

170
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,200
Make Block Six and Seven
first priority...

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
Follow each Section Chief's instructions,
and evacuate immediately.

172
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,100
All shelters in the
city report complete.

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,900
The evacuation of noncombatants and Class D
personnel by ``Alarm C'' is complete.

174
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Are you seriously
going to do this ?

175
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
Yes, I am.

176
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Are you going to abandon the three Eva units because of your selfish decision ?

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,600
The probability of success is only 0.00001%.
Less than one in ten thousand.

178
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
But it's not zero.

179
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,100
Major Katsuragi...!

180
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm the one who's
in charge now.

181
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to do all that I can.
My job is to destroy the Angel.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Your job ?
Don't make me laugh.

183
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,200
It's for you. It's your revenge against the Angels, isn't it ?

184
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,900
NEON GENESIS

185
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,200
What ?!
Catch it by hand ?!

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes. Position the Evas at
the estimated impact point...

187
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,800
...and stop it with
a full AT-field.

188
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
What if the Angel has changed
its course considerably ?

189
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Then, it'll be over.

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,700
What if the units can't
withstand the shock ?

191
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,300
Again, it'll be over.

192
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,600
The probability of success is...?

193
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,100
Only God knows,
so to speak.

194
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,900
If it succeeds,
it'll be a miracle.

195
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,700
Miracles have value only
when we make them happen.

196
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,400
In other words, you're saying that we must manage to do it somehow ?

197
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,500
Sorry, but in this operation,
there's no other way.

198
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,000
How can you call
this an operation ?!

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,200
You're right, I can't. Therefore, if you don't want to, you can refuse.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you ready ?

201
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,700
You're required to write a will.
What're you going to do ?

202
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I don't care.
I'm not going to die.

203
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,100
I won't.
It's unnecessary.

204
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
I won't either.

205
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm sorry. When the operation is over,
I'll treat you to a steak.

206
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,500
Really ?

207
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,700
I promise.

208
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,900
Wow !

209
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Don't forget.

210
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Look forward to it.

211
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,500
Steak means a gorgeous dinner...?

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Does she really think that today's kids would be glad to get steak ?

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,900
How poor some the people of
the Second Impact Generation are.

214
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,200
It can't be helped.

215
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,700
What was that ``WOW ?''
You pretended to be happy.

216
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,800
It's nicer if we make
her command easier.

217
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,500
Anyway, she's
going to treat us.

218
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Where will we go ?

219
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,800
You MUST come this time.

220
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
I won't.

221
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
Why not ?

222
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,200
I hate meat.

223
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,800
The target's been lost
due to the Angel's jamming.

224
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
It's impossible to
estimate the exact point...

225
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,600
...but Magi has estimated the impact point from the available data, and...

226
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,700
...this is it.

227
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,200
Is it this wide ?!

228
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,500
The radius is huge.

229
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,200
The target's AT-field will completely destroy HQ if it falls anywhere within that radius.

230
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,900
Under these conditions, we'll place an Eva Unit at each of these three points.

231
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
What are those
locations based on ?

232
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,600
My intuition.

233
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Intuition ?

234
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
Yes, it's woman's intuition.

235
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,600
How vague. I feel
the miracle fading away.

236
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,900
Misato's never won much.

237
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Ack.

238
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Hey.

239
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
What ?

240
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
Why do you
pilot the Eva ?

241
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,400
It's obvious. To show
my talents to the world.

242
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,900
To show you exist ?

243
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,100
Something like that.

244
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,600
Why don't you
ask that girl ?

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
I've asked her before.

246
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,500
You two sure
get along well.

247
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,400
It's not like that.

248
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,600
How about you, Shinji ?

249
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,300
I don't know.

250
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,500
You don't know ?
Are you stupid ?

251
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
I might be.

252
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,700
You're really stupid.

253
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,200
120 minutes to
estimated impact.

254
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,600
Everyone, take shelter.
I can handle the rest from here.

255
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,400
No, this is
my job too.

256
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,700
I can't let the children be the only ones in danger.

257
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,800
They'll be okay.

258
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,400
Even if the Evas are damaged,
the AT-field will protect them.

259
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,500
The Eva is
the safest place.

260
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,500
Shinji, you asked why
I joined Nerv yesterday.

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,400
My father threw himself into his research... his only dream.

262
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,800
I couldn't forgive him,
rather I hated him.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,900
Just like my father.

264
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,700
He didn't care about me,
my mother or our family.

265
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,000
People said that
he was sensitive...

266
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,400
...but he was so weak that he was always trying to escape from reality, such as family.

267
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
He was like a kid.

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,800
I agreed with my mother when she divorced him, since she was always in tears.

269
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,700
My father seemed shocked...

270
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,200
...but he laughed at himself,
saying it was his fault.

271
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,000
He saved me in exchange
for his life...

272
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,300
...because of the Second Impact.

273
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm confused as to
whether I loved or hated him.

274
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,600
But I'm sure that I have to defeat the Angels that caused the Second Impact.

275
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,400
I joined Nerv
to accomplish that.

276
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,100
It might be that I was
trying to avenge my father...

277
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,500
...in order to be free from my father's binding spell.

278
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Don't run away. Don't run away.
Don't run away.

279
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,700
That's right,
I shouldn't run away.

280
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Target in sight.
Maximum magnification.

281
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,100
Distance, approximately 25000.

282
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,800
Here it comes.

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
All Eva Units, proceed
to the start position.

284
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,300
The target's trajectory can only be calculated using optical observation.

285
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,500
So, Magi will guide you
until a distance of 1000.

286
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
After that, you're on your own.
I trust you all.

287
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
The Angel's approaching.
Distance, approximately 20000.

288
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,900
Then, begin the operation.

289
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Let's go.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,700
Start !

291
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
Distance, 12000 !

292
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,100
Maximum field !

293
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,800
Unit 02, maximum field !

294
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm doing it !

295
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Now !

296
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Bastard !

297
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,500
Communications restored. There's an incoming message from Commander Ikari in Antarctica.

298
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Put it through.

299
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,100
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm very sorry. Due to my actions, Unit 01 was damaged.

301
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,700
I take full responsibility.

302
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,200
It's alright. The Evas' mission is the annihilation of the Angels.

303
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,100
It was fortunate that
the damage was light.

304
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.
Well done, Major Katsuragi.

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
Thank you very much.

306
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,200
By the way, is the
pilot of Unit 01 there ?

307
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Y...yes.

308
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,900
I've heard the story.
Well done, Shinji.

309
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Eh ? Y...yes.

310
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,300
Major Katsuragi,
I leave the rest to you.

311
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,900
Yes, sir.

312
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Next station is Shin-Miyanoshita,
Shin-Miyanoshita.

313
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,500
At the next station
the exit is on the left side.

314
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
You must fulfill
your promise.

315
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
Okay, okay.

316
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,700
I've withdrawn big bucks.
I can pay for a full-course dinner.

317
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,000
...it's before
payday though.

318
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Relax, I know what's
inside your wallet.

319
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Miss Honor Student said
that she'd come if it's ramen.

320
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,500
I'll have garlic flavor
without baked pork.

321
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,800
I'd like shark fin
with baked pork. A large.

322
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,300
Here you go.
Shark fin with baked pork.

323
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,000
Say, Misato...

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
What ?

325
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,500
When I heard my father's words, I found for the first time that it's nice to be praised.

326
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,800
And I also found out that I pilot Eva to hear those words from my father.

327
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,800
THAT'S why you pilot it ?

328
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
You really are stupid.
