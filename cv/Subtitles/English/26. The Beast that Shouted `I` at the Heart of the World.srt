1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,000
SHIN SEIKI

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,700
''zankoku na tenshi no youni''

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,800
''shoonen yo shinwa ni nare''

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,300
''aoi kaze ga ima mune no DOOR wo tataitemo''

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,400
''watashidake wo tada mitsumete hohoenderu anata''

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,200
''sotto fureru mono motomeru koto ni muchuude''

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,900
''unmei sae mada shiranai itaike na hitomi''

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,000
''dakedo itsuka kizuku deshou sono senaka niwa''

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,000
''haruka mirai mezasu tame no hane ga aru koto''

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,200
''zankoku na tenshi no THESE
~ madobe kara yagate tobitatsu''

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,700
''hotobashiru atsui PATHOS
~ de omoide wo uragiru nara''

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,500
''kono sora wo daite kagayaku shoonen yo shinwa ni nare''

13
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,560
It was 2016 A.D.

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,820
The thing people lost,

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,270
in other words, the complementation of the mind is unfolding.

16
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,430
However, there's too little time to describe the entire process.

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,170
Therefore, we will discuss the complementation of the mind of

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,030
one single boy named Ikari Shinji.

19
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,100
Case 3: In the case of Ikari Shinji.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,140
Fear

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,980
That I disappear.

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,190
Yet, I can disappear because I feel that I am useless.

23
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,370
Why?

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,310
Because I am useless.

25
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,140
After all, I am a useless child.

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,250
Nobody cares about me.

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,030
You run away considering nobody cares about you.

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,180
You fear to fail.

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,870
You fear to be disliked.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,340
You fear to see the weakness within you.

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,750
You too!

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,660
Right. We are the same.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,580
Our mind lacks something.

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,910
So we fear it.

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,140
So we worry about it.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,410
So we are trying to be one.

37
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,790
We are trying to complement by the instrumentality of each other.

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,780
That's the instrumentality project.

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,800
One cannot live without being surrounded by others.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
One cannot live alone.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,330
One is always unique.

42
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,280
Causing hardship.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,970
Causing sadness.

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,970
Causing the wish to feel anothers' mind and body.

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,930
Causing the wish to become one.

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,840
A human is made of weak and fragile materials.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,260
The mind and body are also made of weak and fragile materials.

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,770
So it is necessary to complement by the instrumentality of each other.

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,570
Why?

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,750
There's no other way to live.

51
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,020
Is that true?

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,580
Why do you live?

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,940
I've no idea.

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,450
I might live to know why.

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,480
For whom do you live?

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,640
Obviously, for me.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
Probably for myself.

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,100
Is that true?

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,020
You enjoy your life?

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,490
I wonder.

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,280
You enjoy your life?

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,460
Of course yes.

63
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,100
You enjoy your life?

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,040
I don't want to do anything not enjoyable.

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,020
You dislike to be sad?

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,990
I don't like that.

67
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,260
You dislike hardships?

68
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,860
I don't like that.

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,710
So you run away.

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,670
Yes. Do you blame for running away from something I hate?

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,870
I won't run away.

72
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,980
Why won't you run away.

73
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,900
If I ran away, it would be more painful.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,190
You ran away from something painful.

75
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,870
It was painful.

76
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,150
If you know the pain, then everything's OK.

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,200
You may run away if it's painful.

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,970
You can run away from something you truly hate.

79
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,290
Yet, I don't. I don't want to run away.

80
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,420
No. I shall not run away.

81
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,320
It's because you already know that running away will be more painful.

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,620
You know how painful it is to run away.

83
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,120
So you don't want to run away.

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,280
I said, if I ran away, nobody would care about me.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't desert me! Please! Don't desert me!

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,680
Obeying the words of others, that's his way to live.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,980
Right! Otherwise, I would be deserted.

88
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,740
You fear to be hurt.

89
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,110
You are trying to think so.

90
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,740
Not only you but also others are hurt.

91
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,810
Everybody feels hardships.

92
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,230
You think so, because it's easier for you.

93
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,940
Shut up! That has nothing to do with me.

94
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,290
People don't care about me.

95
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,530
And you always desert your value.

96
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,010
I have nothing.

97
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,100
And you try to think yourself valueless.

98
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,950
Thinking that, doing nothing, one would not be hurt.

99
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,460
People try to keep themselves by being praised.

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,310
Nobody accepts me.

101
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,710
You are trying to think so.

102
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,410
So, I have to pilot Eva.

103
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,880
You've been trying to think yourself valueless since the very begining.

104
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,800
I have to do so.

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,590
No, it's not so.

106
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,700
You are trying to think so, anyway.

107
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,910
I am valueless. I have nothing to be proud of.

108
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,590
So you pilot Eva.

109
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,830
Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,730
Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

111
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,500
Before piloting Eva, I had nothing.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,030
The fact that I pilot Eva lets me stay here.

113
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,800
I have nothing else.

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,200
I have nothing else.

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,040
I have nothing. NOTHING.

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,520
The value to live?

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,420
No, I don't have that.

118
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,880
THUS,

119
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,620
I hate myself.

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
I hate you! I hate you!

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,870
Me hate you.

122
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,790
I hate everything about you.

123
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,880
Sorry, but I hate you.

124
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,860
I hate you.

125
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,950
I hate you.

126
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,190
I hate you.

127
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,140
I hate everything about you.

128
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,570
I hate everything you are.

129
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,720
I hate you!

130
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,570
Now, everybody hates me.

131
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,040
People probably hate me.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
You are trying to think so.

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
NO. Because I hate myself.

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,340
So, you are trying to think that others hate you.

135
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,180
I hate, I hate I hate you!

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,990
But, I am praised.

137
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,540
I am praised when I pilot Eva.

138
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,250
I was praised.

139
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,470
So, happy.

140
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,780
I was praised by people!

141
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,340
But, not happy.

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,800
Which is your true mind?

143
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,890
I don't know, or, both of them are my true minds.

144
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,450
So you pilot Eva.

145
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,310
I have nothing but Eva.

146
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,220
Otherwise you cannot keep yourself?

147
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,820
It's true that Eva Unit One is part of your mind.

148
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,990
If you depend on Eva too much,

149
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,870
Eva itself will be yourself.

150
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,600
Eva will be all of yourself.

151
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,390
The true yourself will be nowhere.

152
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,840
It's OK. I've had nothing from the begining.

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,090
I've been learning cello, but got no results.

154
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,700
You just didn't discipline yourself.

155
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,360
But, now that I can pilot Eva...

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,390
No, when you lose Eva, you can do nothing, like me.

157
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,170
Why do you pilot Eva?

158
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,830
Because it's all of me.

159
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,800
The Beast that Shouted "I"
at the Heart of the World

160
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,320
Rain, gloomy mood, just like my mood. I don't like that.

161
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,280
The sinking sun, fading life, my hope. I don't like that.

162
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,830
Morning, the beginning of today, the beginning of

163
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,560
a bad day. I don't like that.

164
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,240
Blue sky. Something warm, something unusual,

165
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,310
something horrible. Something useless. I don't like that.

166
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,310
I hate everybody!

167
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,760
What do you hope for?

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,660
Hate anxiety?

169
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,050
What do you need?

170
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,230
Hate peace?

171
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,070
What do you want?

172
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,900
Don't hate me!

173
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,290
Don't hate me!

174
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,350
What I fear is,

175
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,070
Rejection

176
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,270
What I need is,

177
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,220
Contact and Approval

178
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,590
May I stay by you?

179
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,180
May I stay here?

180
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,840
Do you love me?

181
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,710
Your Mother,

182
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,990
Do you love her?

183
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,950
You want to go to your mom's place?

184
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,590
No, I don't.

185
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,980
Don't you want to go to your dad's place?

186
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,680
No, I don't.

187
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,980
Why not?

188
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,010
Because I fear.

189
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,800
I fear to be hated.

190
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,610
Because I would disappear.

191
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,770
So what?

192
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,430
What do you wish for?

193
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,580
To erase anxiety.

194
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,180
What do you need?

195
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,340
To erase sadness.

196
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,730
You're not happy are you?

197
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,240
For that, I need.. I need my value.

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,350
In order to be appreciated, in order not to be deserted,

199
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,620
I need my VALUE.

200
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,830
That is what you must admit by yourself.

201
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,390
You must admit your own value.

202
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,670
So you pilot Eva.

203
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,610
I don't have any value.

204
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't have the value worth living.

205
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,890
Then, what are you?

206
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,260
Then what am I?

207
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,150
What the hell am I?

208
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,950
What? it's me.

209
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,200
The shape that I show to others...

210
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,100
The symbol representing Shinji

211
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,990
So, one needs the blockade of mind?

212
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,810
This, and this, and this, all these are the representation of me.

213
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,890
Nothing but the things that make others recognize me.

214
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,990
What am I?

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
This is me? The true me? The false me?

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,580
You are you. Yet, you have your own region and border.

217
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,330
Let's see. My clothes, my shoes, my room.

218
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,540
Those are part of myself.

219
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,500
The things linked together by your will.

220
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,390
The thing that I think myself, that is me.

221
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,220
I am nothing but myself.

222
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,810
Yet, I don't understand. Where am I?

223
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,570
What am I? What am I?

224
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,050
Nobody understands me.

225
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,760
You idiot! That's obvious!

226
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,030
Nobody ever understands you.

227
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,130
The one that takes care of you, and the one

228
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,650
that understands you is nobody but yourself.

229
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,720
So, take care of yourself.

230
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,300
But still I don't have myself, so I don't understand myself.

231
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,240
There's no way to take care of myself.

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,340
You are unstable.

233
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,030
You are still unstable.

234
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,530
The present you

235
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,270
The people around the present you.

236
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,270
The environment that surrounds the present you.

237
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,610
None of them last forever.

238
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,360
Your time is always flowing.

239
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,270
You are made of the changing world.

240
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,370
You are the thing that may change according to

241
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,650
your own mind.

242
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,740
What? The world with nothing. The world with nobody.

243
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,540
The world of freedom.

244
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,110
Freedom?

245
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,780
The world of freedom that would never be restrained by anybody.

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,130
Is this Freedom?

247
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,740
Yes. The world of freedom.

248
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,180
As a result, there's nothing.

249
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,060
Unless I think about it.

250
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,730
Yes, unless you think about it.

251
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,030
What the hell! I don't know what I should do.

252
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,510
You are uneasy.

253
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,480
You don't have your own image.

254
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,230
Too vague.

255
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,030
Everything is vague.

256
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,930
That's freedom.

257
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,580
The world in which you can do anything you like.

258
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,720
Yet, you are uneasy.

259
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,960
You don't you know what you should do.

260
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,410
What shall I do?

261
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,200
I give you a restriction.

262
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,450
Now you have a top and bottom.

263
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,820
Now you have lost one degree of freedom.

264
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,270
Now you have to stand on the bottom.

265
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,880
But you obtain a comfort.

266
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,540
You get slightly easier in your mind.

267
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
And you walk.

268
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,090
That is your will.

269
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,390
Is this my will?

270
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,030
The world with the bottom is the world surrounding you.

271
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,320
Yet, you can move freely.

272
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,410
If you wish, you can change the position of the world.

273
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,010
The world does not keep the same position.

274
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,830
That changes through the time flow.

275
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,870
You can also change.

276
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,940
The things that form you are your own mind and

277
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,010
the world surrounding yourself.

278
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,650
Since this is your own world.

279
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,860
The real figure that you conceive.

280
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,200
That is the reality.

281
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,860
This is the world with nothing, the space with nothing, the world with nothing.

282
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The world with nothing but me.

283
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,310
I am less understanding myself.

284
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,240
I feel as if I am going to disappear.

285
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,740
My existence is fading away.

286
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,010
Why?

287
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,740
Because there's nobody but you.

288
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,380
Nobody but me?

289
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,550
Because you have no existence but that of yourself,

290
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,270
You can't figure out your own shape.

291
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,650
My shape?

292
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,210
My image?

293
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,730
Yes. You are getting to know your own shape through seeing the shapes of others.

294
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,490
Seeing the walls of others, you imagine yourself.

295
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,510
You cannot see yourself unless there are others.

296
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,640
Because there are others, I can exist.

297
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,730
If I'm alone, then I will be the same as everything else.

298
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,110
There will be no difference between myself and nothing..

299
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,500
By understanding the difference between you and others,

300
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,230
you form the image of yourself.

301
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,840
The very first other person is your mother.

302
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,140
Your mother is a different person from you.

303
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,880
Yes. I am I. Yet, it's true that others form the shape of my mind.

304
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,050
That's right, Ikari Shinji-kun.

305
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,650
Man, you took a long time to figure it out!

306
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,970
Stupid Shinji!

307
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,620
You wake up now. Stupid Shinji!

308
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,190
Oh, it's you, Asuka?

309
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,180
You say "It's you Asuka?."

310
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,780
Every morning, I come to wake you up so you won't be late for school.

311
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,030
Is that how you thank a childhood friend?

312
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:45,140
Ah... I mean thanks, so, let me sleep a little more.

313
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,860
What a lazy guy! Wake up! Wake up imediately.

314
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh! NO! You, mean stupid horny guy! Unbelievable!

315
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,050
It's morning. It's natural.

316
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,240
Shinji is a lazy kid. He should be more grateful

317
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,760
that Asuka comes to wake him up.

318
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,270
Dear, you have to get ready too.

319
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,120
You're just like Shinji.

320
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,120
Are you ready?

321
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,750
Yes. It's always me who is scolded by Professor Fuyutsuki

322
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,810
when you are late for a meeting.

323
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,790
That's true, he's your biggest fan.

324
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,120
Stop saying stupid things. Change clothes!

325
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,450
hmmm, I see, Yui.

326
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,290
Hurry up!

327
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,140
OK, I know, you're such a pain in the ass sometimes!

328
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,600
What are you saying!

329
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,490
Now, I am off, Ma'am.

330
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,220
I am off.

331
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,990
Bye! Good luck.

332
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,620
Hey, how long are you going to keep reading?

333
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,090
hmmm, I see. Yui.

334
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,130
I hear that today we also have a newcomer.

335
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,620
Well, yes. This city will be the new capital city

336
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,680
after the capital transfer next year.

337
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,640
The population is increasing.

338
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,060
Right. What kinda girl? I hope it's a cute girl!

339
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,620
Phew.. Late for school! It's very bad to be late for

340
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,660
school from the very first day.

341
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,320
Oh, sorry, I am truly in a hurry.

342
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,560
I am very sorry.

343
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,440
Really! Then you saw it? I mean the girl's panty.

344
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,980
I did not intend to see but, only a moment,..

345
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,310
WOW, What a lucky boy you are this morning.

346
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,620
Ouch! What are you doing ?

347
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,850
Suzuhara, don't talk about such stupid things!

348
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,940
Hey, water the plants. You are on duty this week.

349
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,710
What a noisy girl..

350
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,980
What did you say?

351
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,870
He will be controlled after he gets married, Touji will.

352
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,470
You will as well.

353
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,360
How come you say I will be controlled?

354
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,170
YES. I told nothing but the truth.

355
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,970
Why?

356
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,690
You are what you appear to be.

357
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,320
Asuka, You are always talking ..

358
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,670
So peaceful..

359
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,100
Teacher Misato is coming!

360
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,860
Teacher Misato is looking real nice.

361
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,790
That trio of fools, They're real idiots.

362
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,360
Stand up. Bow. Sit down.

363
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,630
Boys be glad! Today, I'm going to introduce you to the transferee

364
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,680
everybody is talking about.

365
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,860
I am Ayanami Rei. Nice to meet you!

366
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,920
You! You are that stupid guy that peeped at my panty this morning.

367
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,230
NO, Stop! Don't say such a thing.

368
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,340
It's you that showed it to Shinji!

369
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,390
You moron, why do you cover that guy?

370
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,590
Are you guys dating?

371
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,020
No! We're just childhood friends.

372
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,390
Stop! It's school time. Be quiet!

373
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,670
Well, You seem to be enjoying yourselves. I am curious as well.

374
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,940
Go ahead.

375
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,910
I've got it. This is also a world.

376
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,910
A possiblity within me.

377
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,450
The me at the moment is not always the me as I am.

378
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,570
There are many selves.

379
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,530
Yes. There must be the me who is not the Eva pilot.

380
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,120
Thinking like that, the real world itself is not always bad.

381
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,880
The real world might not always be bad.

382
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,750
Yet, I hate myself.

383
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,990
It's your mind that conceives that the reality is bad and hateful.

384
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,520
The mind which confuses the reality with the truth.

385
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,930
The view angle, the position. If these are slightly different,

386
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,960
the things inside the mind will change a lot.

387
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,640
The truths are as many as people.

388
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,880
But there's only one truth that you have,

389
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,470
which is formed by a narrowed view of the world.

390
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,590
Formed by revised information to protect yourself,

391
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,840
the twisted truth.

392
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,070
Oh, yes. the view of the world that one can

393
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,700
have is quite small.

394
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,540
Yes, one measures things only by one's own small measure.

395
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,570
One sees things with the truth given by others.

396
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,010
Happy on a sunny day.

397
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,190
Gloomy on a rainy day.

398
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,300
If that's what you're taught, that's what you'll always think.

399
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,440
Even so, you may enjoy rainy days.

400
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,120
Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it.

401
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,630
That's how fragile truth is.

402
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,680
The truth within a human is so cheap that

403
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,650
people wish to know a deeper truth.

404
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,870
It's only that you are not used to be liked by people.

405
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,520
So, you don't have to look upon other's face.

406
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,890
Yet, don't you hate me?

407
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,700
You idiot! It's you that is always trying to think so.

408
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,100
Still, I hate myself.

409
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,150
Those who hate themselves cannot love or trust others.

410
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,630
I am wicked, a coward, weak and ..

411
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,180
If you know yourself, you can be kind to others.

412
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,400
I hate myself.

413
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,330
But, I might be able to love myself.

414
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,380
Maybe my life could have a greater value.

415
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,730
Yes. I am nothing but I.

416
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,200
I am I. I wish to be I.

417
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,780
I want to continue existing in this world!

418
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,130
I am worth living here!

419
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,980
Congratulations!

420
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,370

425

427

429

430

431

432
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,670
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

433
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,430
Thank you!

434
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,800
Thank you, my father.

435
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,460
Good bye, my mother.

436
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,970
And to the all the children,

437
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,360
Congratulations!
