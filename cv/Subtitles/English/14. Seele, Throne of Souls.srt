16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
It was in 2015 A.D.

17
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100
The Third Angel

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Sachiel, attacks.

19
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,600
Ordinary weapons were ineffective against the Angel.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,100
The UN aborted
the mission.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
All authority transferred directly to the Special Institute, NERV.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Midnight, the same day, the Angel arrived above NERV headquarters.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,800
The same day, they acquired...

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,300
...the Third Child.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,100
Ikari Shinji

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
He agreed to be the pilot.

27
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,800
Evangelion Unit 01 launched for the first time.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,100
NERV experienced its
first actual battle.

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
The first battle in Tokyo-3.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,700
Eva Unit 01,
head damaged,
out of control.

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Complete silence.

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,500
Then...

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,100
IT WENT BERSERK !

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,700
Interim report on the
``Battle in Tokyo-3.''

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,700
The person in charge:
Planning Manager
Captain Katsuragi Misato

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,500
As a result, we suffered
major damage, but...

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,000
...the challenge of an unexperienced boy in the first battle against the unknown target...

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,700
...and the fact that he carried out the mission, were indeed admirable deeds by Ikari Shinji.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
However, for the planning section...

40
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,500
...it was a hard battle that revealed further problems and many points to improve.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
The Third Angel as well as Unit 01...

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
...developed an AT-Field.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,300
Unit 01 eroded the
target's AT-Field.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
Angel, destroyed.

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Intercept installation, slightly damaged.
Eva Unit 01, medium damage.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
The victims in this
incident were not publicized.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Excerpt from
Suzuhara Touji's
composition:

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,800
My sister's in the second grade.
She was injured in that incident.

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
The injury wasn't due to the enemy, but to that wild robot on our side.

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,400
I can't forgive such a
ridiculous story, man !

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,500
I wanna make those adults, who made the robot, know my sister's pain and my anger.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,900
The Fourth Angel

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Shamusiel, attacks.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,800
At that time, the performance of the surface-to-air intercept system was down to 48.2%.

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,300
The operational ratio of Tokyo-3's
battle formation was 96.8%.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Excerpt from
Horaki Hikari's
composition:

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,900
Since I'd practiced the evacuation training many times with classmates...

58
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,900
...it was just an everyday occurance.
I didn't actually realize the situation.

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,500
The boys were making noise as
if they were on a field trip.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,200
We girls weren't
afraid of anything.

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,300
Angel arrives
above Tokyo-3.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
The second battle in Tokyo-3.

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,600
Despite accidental cutoff
of power supply...

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
Angel, destroyed.

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,400
NERV obtained a sample of an Angel in its original condition.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,600
However, the final analysis report is not being released.

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
The Fifth Angel

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,300
Ramiel, attacks.

69
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,900
Against the seemingly invincible target...

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,600
Captain Katsuragi's
proposed
Operation Yashima
was approved.

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,300
The First Child

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit 00.

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,100
Ayanami Rei

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,400
Launched in the unfrozen Eva Unit 00 for the first time.

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Midnight,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the same day,~~~~~~~~
part of the Angel~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~penetrated the Geo-Front.

76
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,500
NERV executed Operation Yashima.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Excerpt from
Aida Kensuke's
personal diary:

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,300
Ikari didn't say anything.

79
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,600
But I think, at that time...

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,500
...Unit 00 protected Unit 01 with her life from the enemy's particle-cannon.

81
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,300
No, I am sure about that.
It's because of only one reason.

82
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
It's Ayanami.

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,200
It seems that she regards herself as being insignificant.

84
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
Different from pessimism...

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
But she already has
something like that.

86
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,200
She seems to be more mature than rest of us at the age of 14.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Operation Yashima successful.

88
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,600
Eva Unit 00 heavily damaged.

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,400
However, the pilot survived.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,100
The Sixth Angel

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Gagiel, encountered.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
The Second Child.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit 02.

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,400
Souryu Asuka Langley

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Launches in Eva Unit 02 for the first time.

96
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
A close-range battle at sea...

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,400
And...

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
...the first underwater battle occured.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
The battle was around the former Ito area.

100
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Angel, destroyed.

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,500
That incident was slightly
different from our scenario.

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,800
But the result was within the predicted margins. It's possible to correct.

103
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,100
During the battle, the UN navy
lost one third of its ships.

104
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,700
The ships lost were your country's.
That's negligible.

105
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,300
Right. It was fortunate that
damage was so light.

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,500
The Seventh Angel

107
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
Israfel, attacks.

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,200
It demonstrated the ability to separate and unite.

109
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,200
However, with the simultaneous double attacks by the two Eva units...

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Angel, destroyed.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,100
The Eighth Angel

112
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,300
Sandalfon was found in the Asamayama crater.

113
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
NERV issued order A-17.

114
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,500
A capture operation was carried out for the first time as a top priority.

115
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,300
It was briefly contained in
the electromagnetic cage, but...

116
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,300
...the cage was destroyed,
and the operation was aborted.

117
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,800
The objective was immediately changed to the destruction of the Angel.

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Eva unit 02 carried
out the operation.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
Angel, destroyed.

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,300
The repairs and modifications to Eva Unit 00 were completed, and...

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
...it returned to service.

122
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,600
The Ninth Angel

123
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Matriel, attacks.

124
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,300
In the first joint operation of all three Eva units...

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,900
Angel, destroyed.

126
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
The Tenth Angel

127
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,800
Sahquiel, attacks.

128
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,700
Against the object that fell from the stratosphere...

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,300
...the three Eva units used a direct snare attack...

130
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,700
Angel, destroyed.

131
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
The Eleventh Angel

132
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,900
Currently, its invasion
remains unconfirmed.

133
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,300
Leaked information says that it directly invaded NERV headquarters.

134
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,900
This isn't going right.
It's too early.

135
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,700
Human complement committee special conference.

136
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,400
Right. We didn't expect an
Angel to invade NERV HQ.

137
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,400
This allowed the Angel to advance into Central Dogma.

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,900
If it had made contact, the whole project could have been jeopardized.

139
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,600
The report to the committee was false. There's no proof that an Angel invaded HQ.

140
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Then, Ikari, you deny the
invasion of the 11th Angel.

141
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes.

142
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Be careful what you say at this conference. False testimony means death.

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,800
You can check Magi's recorder. It didn't record anything to support such a conclusion.

144
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,300
Don't make me laugh.
Coverups are your specialty.

145
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,700
The time schedule is proceeding as described in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

146
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,500
It's alright. We won't refer to your crime and responsibility this time.

147
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,800
But don't create
a new scenario.

148
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,900
I know. Everything will
follow Seele's scenario.

149
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Episode 14

150
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Seele, Throne of the Soul ``Seele, tamashii no za''

151
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Mountain. Heavy mountain.
It changes over a long period.

152
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,900
The sky. Blue sky. Invisible objects. Visible objects.

153
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
The sun. There's only one.

154
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Water. Something comfortable.
Commander Ikari.

155
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,800
Flowers. There're many of the same ones.
There're many unnecessary ones also.

156
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,000
The sky.
Red, red sky.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
The color red.
I don't like red.

158
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Flowing water.
Blood.

159
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,700
The smell of blood.
A girl who never bleeds.

160
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,500
A human created from red clay.
A human created by a man and woman.

161
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,700
City. It's built by humans.
Eva. It's built by humans.

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,800
What is a human ?
It's created by God.

163
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,300
Humans were created by humans.

164
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,500
I have a life...heart. A casing for the heart, the entry plug.

165
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
It's the throne of the soul.

166
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,800
Who is this ?
It's me.

167
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,900
Who am I ?

168
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
What am I ?

169
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
What am I ?

170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
What am I ?

171
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
What am I ?

172
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:34,200
I am myself. This object is myself. It's a shape of myself, a visible self.

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,800
But I don't feel
like I'm myself.

174
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,500
It's very strange.

175
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,400
I feel like I'm going to dissolve. I can't recognize myself. My figure's disappearing.

176
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,500
I feel someone else.
Is there anyone beyond here ?

177
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
Ikari.

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
I know her.
She's Major Katsuragi.

179
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,700
Doctor Akagi.
Everyone. Classmate.

180
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,300
The pilot of Unit 02.

181
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,000
Commander Ikari.

182
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Who are you ?

183
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
Who are you ?

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
Who are you ?

185
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
What is your impression of being inside of the Unit 01 for the first time ?

186
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,300
It smells like Ikari.

187
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,800
1st unit mutual compatibility experiment. Subject: Ayanami Rei

188
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,300
Synchro ratio is almost
the same as Unit 00.

189
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,400
Because the personal patterns of
Unit 00 and Unit 01 are similar.

190
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,100
That's why she
can synchronize.

191
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,800
Error is plus minus 0.03.
Harmonics, normal.

192
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,800
I can't find any problems in the compatibility between Rei and Unit 01.

193
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,300
The test is complete.
Rei, you can come back.

194
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Okay.

195
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,500
87th harmonics experiment.
Subject: Souryu Asuka Langley.

196
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
The data bank of
Unit 02 is complete.

197
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Harmonics, normal.

198
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
The pilot has no problem.

199
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,500
Of course not.

200
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,400
Unit 00 natural compatibility experiment. Subject: Ikari Shinji

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
What about the personal
data of Unit 00 ?

202
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,000
It's already rewritten.
Currently double-checking it.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What about the subject ?

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,900
He's a little nervous, but there's no problem in his nerve pattern.

205
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,000
It's natural because this is his first time in Unit 00.

206
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,600
How stupid. He should forget
about it and relax.

207
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,900
Shinji's a boy who
can't do that.

208
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,200
I know.
That's why he's stupid.

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,400
By the way, this compatibility test...
I don't have to join in ?

210
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
You have no intention of
piloting the other Eva, right ?

211
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,600
Well, that's true.

212
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Surely Unit 02
is incompatible.

213
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,100
The entry's begun.

214
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
LCL charged.

215
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Start the first contact.

216
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,000
How do you feel about
Unit 00's entry plug ?

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
I feel strange.

218
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,700
Are you uncomfortable ?

219
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,400
No, it just
smells like Ayanami...

220
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Smell...?
Is he perverted or what ?

221
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,000
Data reception, confirmed.
Pattern, green.

222
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,700
Main power's connected.

223
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,400
Each binder has no problem.

224
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Alright. Then, shift the compatibility test to the second stage.

225
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
Second contact
begun with Unit 00.

226
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
How is it ?

227
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,800
As expected, he doesn't show as high a synchro ratio as with Unit 01.

228
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,500
Harmonics are all normal.

229
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,100
It's an acceptable figure.
We can start the project.

230
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
You mean the dummy system...?

231
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
Honestly speaking,
I'm not really...

232
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:51,400
I know you're not in favor, but we have to be prepared in order to survive.

233
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,700
I respect you, and I'll do my job,
but I don't understand.

234
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,900
It's difficult to live with
people if you're fastidious.

235
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,500
You'll understand that once you discover that you're ruined.

236
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,500
Start the third contact.

237
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,200
Self psychology graph's stable.

238
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,500
What do you think of mommy's breasts ?
Or is that the womb ?

239
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,300
Asuka, that creates noise,
don't bother him.

240
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Okay, okay.

241
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,200
Why do they
only pamper Shinji ?

242
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
Start connecting
the A10 nerve system.

243
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,500
Harmonics level, plus 20.

244
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,900
What's this ?
It's coming into my head.

245
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,000
Directly...something...

246
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Ayanami...?

247
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,300
Ayanami Rei.

248
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,900
This is the feeling
of Ayanami Rei.

249
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,800
Ayanami.

250
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,500
Or maybe not ?

251
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,400
What happened ?!

252
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
There's a problem in
the pilot's nerve pulse.

253
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Psychological contamination
is in progress.

254
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,000
That can't be.
It's impossible at this plug depth.

255
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,100
It's not from the plug.
It's from the Eva.

256
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,500
Unit 00 is out of control.

257
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,400
Shut down all circuits,
and cut the power.

258
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,200
Eva's switched
to backup power.

259
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,600
It's still moving.

260
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
How's Shinji ?

261
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
The circuit's cut off.
I can't monitor him.

262
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
Unit 00 rejected Shinji...?!

263
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
It's no use, the auto
ejection isn't working !

264
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,300
Is this going to be the same ?
Is it going to absorb Shinji ?

265
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Rei, get out of there !

266
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Unit 00 will be immobilized
in ten seconds...

267
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Rei !

268
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
...nine...

269
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
...eight...

270
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,400
...seven...

271
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,200
...six...

272
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,900
...five...

273
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,800
...four...

274
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,500
...three...

275
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,200
...two...

276
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,100
...one...

277
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,000
...zero.

278
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,900
Unit 00's immobilized.

279
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,900
Hurry and rescue the pilot !

280
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,000
It wasn't trying
to kill Rei, was it ?

281
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,500
Is this incident relevant to the previous accident with Rei ?

282
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,000
I can't say at this moment...

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
...but we have to put Rei's data back and do a synchro test immediately.

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,800
As tactical chief, I request you do it immediately so it won't affect our operations.

285
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,500
I know, Major Katsuragi.

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,000
Unit 00 wanted to hit me.
I'm sure of it.

287
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,300
The next contestant is
a dog that can do math.

288
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,500
That's amazing.

289
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
She's the genius dog,
Kana, from Niigata.

290
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,100
Nice voice.
Do you understand what I say ?

291
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,600
Oh, really ?

292
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Then, answer the question, okay ?

293
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,900
325 minus 324 equals...?

294
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,700
Incredible. She's right.
The answer is one.

295
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,700
No, not this ceiling again.

296
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,900
Shinji's regained consciousness. There were no aftereffects of the contamination.

297
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,300
They say he doesn't
remember anything.

298
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,300
I see.

299
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Neither Misato nor
Kaji will tell me.

300
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,900
Shinji doesn't know either.

301
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
What kind of
girl is the First ?

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,100
Unexpected invasion of the Angel...

303
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,600
The Human Complement Committee knew
about it and accused us, huh ?

304
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,500
They're boring people
who can only complain.

305
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,200
We have all the trump cards.
They can't do anything.

306
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,700
But you don't have to irritate them. It'll cause many problems if Seele comes forward now.

307
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Everything's following our scenario.
There's no problem.

308
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,200
What about the accident with Unit 00 ?
It wasn't written in my scenario.

309
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Unimportant. The resynchronization of Rei and Unit 00 was successful.

310
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,100
You're too concerned
with Rei, Ikari.

311
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
What about the
ADAM Project ?

312
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,100
It's going fine. It's behind schedule by no more than 2 percent.

313
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,300
What about the
Longinus Lance then ?

314
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,500
It's going as planned.
Rei's carrying it out.
