1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Like a cruel angel...

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,700
...young boy, become a legend.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:39,200
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Lost while searching for something soft...

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,400
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,800
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

8
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,900
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:16,100
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,500
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:31,300
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900
Neon Genesis

13
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,820
Katsuragi, it's me.

14
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm sure you're listening to this message,
after I caused you so much trouble.

15
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,090
Sorry.

16
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,890
Please tell Rit-chan "I'm sorry".

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,900
And there's one more thing to trouble
you with.  I've been growing flowers.

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,820
I'd appreciate it if you
could water them for me.

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,860
Shinji-kun knows where they are.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,650
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
Don't hesitate.  Move ahead.

21
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,140
If I can see you again, I'll say the
words that I couldn't say 8 years ago.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,740
Bye.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,990
A telephone that doesn't ring...

24
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,260
ON BUSINESS
Sorry, but don't
call me

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,940
Misato-san's shutting herself
up today, as usual.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,790
Authorized Personnel ONLY
If you enter without my
permission, you shall die!
Entry Forbidden!

27
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,250
Asuka...  she isn't coming back today?

28
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,430
She doesn't go to school or home,
she just plays games all day.

29
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,360
Hikari...

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,360
Hmm, what?

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,890
Let's go to bed.

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,470
Yeah.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,930
Sorry, I'm inconveniencing you.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,950
No, you're not.

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,460
I didn't win with Eva.

36
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,570
I lost all my values for everything.

37
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,250
I hate...  I really hate...  I hate everything.

38
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,190
Though I hate myself the most.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,760
Now I don't care about anything.
I have nothing to do.

40
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,160
I think you can do anything you want to.
I don't blame you.

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,840
I really think you've done well.

42
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,380
Well, that child is gone.

43
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,760
Hmm, probably.

44
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,080
Even cats die.

45
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,750
Don't cry, Grandma.

46
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,110
Mm, I'll come home when I have time to.

47
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,100
I haven't been to my mom's
grave in three years.

48
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,780
Next time, I'll call you.

49
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,870
OK, I have to go.

50
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,730
So, that cat died.

51
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,370
Episode 23'
TEARS

52
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,430
It's impossible for us to
retrieve the Lance of Longinus.

53
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,040
Why did you use it?

54
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,580
And about the Eva series, we
don't have all of them scheduled.

55
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,180
The annihilation of the Angel was more
important.  There was no other way.

56
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,160
No other way?  Your excuses
should be more persuasive.

57
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,220
The things you have done recently are too bold.

58
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,480
Fuyutsuki, I'm in a conference.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,340
Understood.

60
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,470
An Angel is approaching right now.

61
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,530
We'll finish this discussion
at the next opportunity.

62
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,300
That is, if your chair remains.

63
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,480
Ikari, are you going to betray Seele?

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,110
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Launch Unit 00 from the 32nd gate.
Set Unit 02 as backup.

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,830
No, I don't have the right to cancel
Commander Ikari's freeze on Unit 01.  Bye.

67
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,420
Angel confirmed visually...  right?

68
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,020
Unit 00, move out!  To the intercept position.

69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,880
Unit 02, wait at your present position.

70
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,390
No, sortie.

71
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,390
Commander!

72
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,130
I don't care.  At least it
might be useful as a decoy.

73
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,440
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,600
Eva Unit 02, be ready to sortie.

75
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,540
I'm on board again, as usual.

76
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,960
Oh, no.  Am I still attached to this?

77
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,020
Unit 02, to the 8th gate.

78
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,540
Move out, as soon as the
launch position is determined.

79
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,510
Even if I sortie, all I can do is disturb the others.

80
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,100
Target approaching.  Passing by
the final defense line at Goura.

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,460
I don't care about anything, anymore.

82
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,520
Target floating above Owaku Valley.
Rotating at a fixed position.

83
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,470
Target's AT Field is still active.

84
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,410
Where have you been?

85
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,860
I don't have an excuse.
Present status?

86
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,080
Still a stalemate.

87
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,670
Changing cyclically from pattern blue to orange.

88
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,660
What does that mean?

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,050
The Magi indicate that it's impossible to tell.

90
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,810
The data is insufficient to find an answer.

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,910
But I'm sure that shape isn't fixed.

92
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,700
Our side can't attack first.

93
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,550
Rei, we'll observe its status for a while.

94
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,940
No, it's coming.

95
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,750
Rei, prepare for battle!

96
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,500
No!  It's too late!

97
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,520
Target has physically contacted Unit 00.

98
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,610
Unit 00's AT Field?

99
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,680
Developing, but being penetrated.

100
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,430
The Angel is trying to achieve
first level contact with Unit 00?

101
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,480
Danger!  Unit 00's bioparts are being penetrated.

102
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,990
Eva Unit 02, sortie!  Have her
rescue Rei and provide cover.

103
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,350
Progressing, and penetrating further.

104
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,430
This is dangerous.  5% has
already been bio-fused.

105
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,370
Asuka, advance 300 meters and
develop an AT Field, then fire the
palette gun at the Target's back.

106
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,210
Alright?  Eva Unit 02, lift off!

107
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,580
Move out!  Asuka?!  What's wrong?

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,750
Unit 02's status?

109
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,480
Impossible.  Synchro ratio is under 10%.

110
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,120
Asuka!

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,030
...doesn't move.  It doesn't move.

112
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,790
Like this, she'll be a victim too.
Retrieve her!  Hurry!

113
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,330
Who?  Me?  Me within Eva?

114
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,430
No, I feel someone else other than me.

115
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,900
Who are you?  An Angel?

116
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,390
The being that we call an Angel?

117
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,730
Don't you want to be unified with me?

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,930
No.  I am I.  Not you.

119
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,390
Hmm, but you shall be.  It's too late.

120
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,850
I give you part of my mind.

121
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,190
I give you this emotion.

122
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,040
Pain...  See, your mind has pain.

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,700
Pain?  No, something different.

124
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,650
Loneliness.  Yes, loneliness.

125
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
Loneliness?  I don't understand.

126
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,930
Do you hate being alone?

127
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,670
We are many, though you hate being alone.

128
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,110
That's called loneliness.

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,830
That's your mind.  Full of sadness.

130
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,010
That's your own mind.

131
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,230
These are tears.

132
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,110
It's me who's crying.

133
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,230
Rei!

134
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,740
The freeze on Unit 01 is
canceled, effective immediately.

135
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,490
Sortie as soon as possible.

136
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,200
Sortie!

137
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,540
Yes, sir!

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,990
What's this?  Last time, he wouldn't use that for me.

139
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,650
Develop your AT Field and rescue Rei!  Quickly!

140
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,240
Yes, ma'am!

141
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,260
Ikari-kun!

142
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,340
Shinji-kun, use your prog knife!

143
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,970
It hurts, doesn't it Ikari-kun?

144
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,530
Is this my heart?  To be one with Ikari-kun?

145
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,460
No.

146
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,590
AT Field reversed.  Penetrated instantly!

147
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,530
To hold the Angel?

148
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,860
Field limit reached!  The core
can't hold up much longer!

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,090
Rei!  Abandon the unit and escape!

150
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,250
No.  If I escape, the AT
Field will disappear.

151
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,950
So I won't.

152
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,640
Rei, do you want to die?

153
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,190
The core is collapsing, passing
through the critical point.

154
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,400
The target has disappeared.

155
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,590
This operation is finished.

156
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,350
Move to level one alert.

157
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,550
Roger.  Moving to situation yellow immediately.

158
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,710
Unit 00's status?

159
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,590
Entry plug ejection not recognized.

160
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,400
Rescue the survivor.  Hurry!

161
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,940
You mean, if there is one.

162
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,560
Still unable to find the constituent matter for
section 16.  Location efforts proceeding.

163
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,560
...extending in the southwest direction.

164
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,960
Dr. Akagi...

165
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,740
This is top secret.  Scavenge the plug.

166
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,530
Dispose of the parts concerned.

167
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,030
Roger.

168
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Do it immediately.

169
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,440
The 3rd Angel

170
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:09,920
Sachiel

171
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,190
The 4th Angel

172
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,410
At last we have defeated
the Angels, up to the 16th.

173
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:10,700
Shamshiel

174
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:10,940
The 5th Angel

175
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,420
Ramiel

176
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,690
The 6th Angel

177
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,200
Gahgiel

178
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,440
The 7th Angel

179
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:12,950
Israphel

180
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,190
The 8th Angel

181
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,410
Now there is only one Angel left, which is
described in the Dead Sea Scrolls of Seele.

182
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,700
Sandalphon

183
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:13,940
The 9th Angel

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,450
Matriel

185
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:14,690
The 10th Angel

186
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,200
Sahquiel

187
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,440
The 11th Angel

188
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:15,950
Ireul

189
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,190
The 12th Angel

190
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,700
Leriel

191
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:16,940
The 13th Angel

192
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,430
Bardiel

193
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,640
The 14th Angel

194
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,680
The promised time is close.  The road
has been long, with many casualties.

195
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,220
Zeruel

196
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,460
The 15th Angel

197
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:18,940
Arael

198
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,180
The 16th Angel

199
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:19,720
Armisael

200
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,580
Aye.  After losing the Lance of
Longinus, we lost Eva Unit 00.

201
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,910
That's sufficient reason to dismiss Ikari.

202
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,930
He must understand why
we returned Fuyutsuki alive.

203
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,890
A new sacrifice against Ikari is needed.

204
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,700
And the one must know the truth.

205
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,470
Shinji-kun, I'm coming in.

206
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,620
Misato-san, the tears won't come.

207
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,120
I think I'm sad, but tears never come.

208
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:29,780
Shinji-kun, all I can do for you is this.

209
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,580
Stop it!  No, Misato-san.

210
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm very sorry.

211
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,500
<i>Although he must be lonely,
maybe he fears a woman.</i>

212
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,480
<i>No, he fears communication with people.</i>

213
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,770
Pen Pen, come here.

214
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
<i>I see, anybody will do.</i>

215
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,850
<i>It's me who's lonely.</i>

216
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,300
Rei...

217
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:16,900
The product of my despair,
and yet the object of your hope.

218
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,190
I guess it's impossible to forget her.

219
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,790
Yes, hello.  Really?!

220
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Shinji-kun!

221
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,500
Dr. Odani of the First Internal Department...

222
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,830
Dr. Odani, please contact the second
conference room immediately.

223
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,540
Ayanami!

224
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,780
First Neurological Surgery
Third Surgery

225
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,880
2nd Floor
Hospital Ward
Radiation Diagnosis
X-ray Reception

226
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,260
I'm glad, you're alive!

227
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,040
But, my father isn't here?

228
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,610
Thank you.  You saved me.

229
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,500
What?

230
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,050
You saved me, by abandoning Unit 00.

231
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh, did I save you?

232
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,990
Yeah.  Don't you remember?

233
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,290
No...  I mean, I don't know.
I think, probably, I'm the third.

234
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,520
Are these tears?

235
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,180
I'm seeing these for the first time, but it
doesn't seem to me to be the first time.

236
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,840
I...  am I crying?

237
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,020
Why...  am I crying?

238
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,860
That's right.  Preserve the present
status for the First Children.

239
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,030
No need to capture.

240
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,000
This applies to the Second and
Third as well.  Just watch them.

241
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,390
Yet, if they find out Rei is alive, Chairman
Kihl and the others will blame us.

242
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll present something else to the
old men of Seele.  There's no problem.

243
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,730
We wish to proceed peacefully.

244
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,350
We don't wish you to suffer from insults anymore.

245
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,820
I don't feel any insult.

246
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,690
A strong tempered woman.

247
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
It's quite natural for Ikari to keep her close.

248
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:46,470
However, it was none other than
Ikari-kun who presented you to us.

249
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,620
Rejecting the interrogation of the pilot of Unit 00,
he presented you as her replacement, Dr. Akagi.

250
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm Rei's replacement?

251
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,630
ON BUSINESS
Sorry, but don't
call me

252
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,180
The way to the truth which you wanted,
was sent to you by 36 other methods.

253
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,830
But those won't reach you.

254
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,230
The only one guaranteed is this capsule.

255
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,060
It's completely up to you how to use this.

256
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,140
The pass code is our first memory.

257
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,970
Bye.  Take care.

258
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm not upset anymore by
the telephone that doesn't ring...

259
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,230
...since I received your mind.

260
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,640
Is Dr. Akagi's disposition acceptable?

261
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,820
Different from Fuyutsuki.
It's better for us to return her.

262
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,870
She rendered remarkable
service to the Eva series.

263
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
She should be useful to us for a while.

264
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,630
Aye, for the future of humanity.

265
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,330
Regarding Evangelions, eight of
them are under construction.

266
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,760
Four more are not.

267
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,060
The disappearance of the Third New
Tokyo City will enhance the project.

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,140
Hurry with the completion.
The promised day will be that day.

269
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,940
Yes, hello.

270
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,470
Listen to me.  You're free from
the secret service right now.

271
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,300
You can go out immediately.

272
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,690
Ritsuko-san...

273
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,700
No good, without my pass.

274
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,680
I see.  Kaji-kun arranged this?

275
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,010
The secret of this place must
be revealed before my eyes.

276
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,690
Alright.  And this child will see it as well.

277
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,520
Very well.

278
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,300
This looks just like Ayanami's room.

279
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,250
Ayanami Rei's room.  This is
the place where she was born.

280
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,550
In this room?

281
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,570
Yes, her birth place.

282
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,160
Light and water, which make up Rei's
deep mentality, reflect the image of this place.

283
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,860
Dr. Akagi, I didn't come to see this.

284
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,270
I know, Misato.

285
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,480
Eva?

286
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,270
The first one.  A failure.

287
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,240
Disposed of 10 years ago.

288
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,560
A graveyard for Evas.

289
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,150
Nothing but a dumping ground.

290
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,050
This is also the place where
your mother disappeared.

291
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,150
You probably don't remember,
but you were watching it, watching the
moment when your mother disappeared.

292
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,470
Ritsuko!

293
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,200
You say this is the core of the dummy plug?

294
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,290
I'll show you the truth.

295
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,670
Ayanami...  Rei.

296
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,040
What?  Eva's dummy plug is...

297
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes.  These are about to be
the core of the dummy system.

298
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,680
This is the factory for manufacturing them.

299
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,900
This is...?

300
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,790
These are dummies.

301
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,480
And nothing but parts for Rei.

302
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,540
Humans found a god, and thus tried to obtain it.

303
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,170
As a result, humanity was punished.
That was 15 years ago.

304
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,100
The god that they found vanished.

305
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,040
However, they tried to revive the god themselves.

306
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,940
It was Adam.  A human was made
from Adam to be close to the god.

307
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,540
That is Eva.

308
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,730
Human?  Is that a human?

309
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,790
Yes, that's a human.

310
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,890
Eva, which originally didn't have
a soul, now has a human soul.

311
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,200
All of these were salvaged.

312
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,870
However the vessel which truly contains
a soul is Rei.  Only she has a soul.

313
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,500
None of the other vessels have a soul.

314
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,270
There was nothing within the room of Gauf.

315
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,450
These Rei-like things here don't have a soul.

316
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,020
Nothing but vessels.

317
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,170
So I'll destroy them, because I hate them.

318
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,810
Do you know what you're doing?!

319
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,390
Yeah, I know.  Destruction.

320
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,640
These are not human, but human-shaped things.

321
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,870
I lost against the THING.  I couldn't win.

322
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,080
When he's in my mind, I can bear any insult.

323
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,390
I don't care about my own body.

324
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,500
But...  but he...  he did...

325
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,420
I knew that.

326
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,300
I'm stupid.  I...  I'm as stupid
as my mother.  So foolish!

327
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,590
You can kill me, if you wish.

328
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,410
I'd be glad if you did.

329
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,100
You're truly stupid if you wish that.

330
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,590
This is the tragedy of people possessed by Eva.

331
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm also one of them.

332
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,560

The city is gone, his friends have left,

340
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,900
and a boy smiles at the heartbroken Shinji.
