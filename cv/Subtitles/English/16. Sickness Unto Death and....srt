16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Shin-chan, did you
change the soup stock ?

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Yeah, it's bonito.
It's a souvenir from Ritsuko.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,100
Hot !

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Sorry.

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,600
You apologized so easily !
Do you REALLY feel sorry ?!

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,500
Shinji, you always apologize as if it's a conditioned reflex to avoid criticism !

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,600
Sorry.

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
See ? You're so self-destructive,
to the core...

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Now, now.
That's his lifestyle.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're so naive giving
in to his lifestyle !

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
You're so understanding
towards Shinji lately !

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,500
Am I ?

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,900
Just because you restored
your relationship with Kaji...

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,400
...I don't want you to show
off how happy you are.

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
There's nothing
between Kaji and me.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Yo, Katsuragi. I found a bar with good liquor. How about tonight ? Bye.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,200
I've never had such an
indecent adult relationship, like you !

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
What's with you ?!
You act just like a parent !

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,800
You're so hypocritical !
It's disgusting !

''Shi ni

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Type B harmonics test, normal.

39
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,900
All depth parameters cleared.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,400
Misato, you look tired.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Because of various
private reasons...

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,700
Kaji ?

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,500
Shut up !

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,800
How's the
Third Child doing ?

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Look at this.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Let's see...

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,100
I hope this helps him gain
a little more confidence.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
Can you hear me, Shinji ?

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,900
Misato, how was the
result from that test ?

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,700
Hi, kimi ga ichiban !

51
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,000
He's done it !
He surpassed me easily !

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,900
He did it so easily,
that to be honest, I'm irritated !

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,500
Great, wonderful,
strong, so strong !

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,900
Oh, unbeatable Shinji...

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Our job'll be easier !

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,000
Right ?  We must work harder so we won't be left behind.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Bye.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Next stop is Seishoukaose,
Seishoukaose...

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,400
...in front of Bashohal's
used books and software...

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Alright.

61
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,500
It'll take five more minutes to evacuate the west district.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,700
Target's slowly moving
forward at 2.5km per hour.

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,000
You're late.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Sorry !

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,500
What was the observation
post at Mt. Fuji doing ?!

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,700
They didn't detect anything !
It suddenly appeared directly above us !

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,400
Pattern, orange !
No AT-field detected !

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,300
What does it mean ?

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Is that a new
kind of Angel ?

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Magi's withholding
their conclusion.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Geez, why's Commander Ikari
absent at a time like this ?

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
Everyone, do you hear me ?

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Target data's sent to you.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
That's all we know so far.

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,600
Engage slowly, observe its response and lure it outside the city if possible.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,500
Unit 02 will backup
the forward, okay ?

77
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Yes, teacher, I think Shinji
should take the forward !

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Naturally.

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,100
This's a job for a brave and courageous man with the higher grade and No.1 synchro ratio.

80
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,500
Or Shin-chan,
maybe you aren't confident ?

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,500
I'll go !
I'll show you how it's done !

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
W...what did you say ?!

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, you guys...

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,100
You told me
I'm number one.

85
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,400
Well, that was...

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Combat's a man's job.

87
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,900
How anachronistic.
Unit 02 will backup.

88
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,600
Unit 00 will backup, too.

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,000
Those kids've gone
on their own...

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Shinji's become quite brave.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,300
No. I'll have to
scold him when he's back.

92
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,700
You can be a
good babysitter.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Ayanami, Asuka,
are you in position ?

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,300
Not yet.

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,900
I can't move that fast.

96
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,100
Not yet ?

97
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,300
Well then,
I have to stop it myself.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,100
It disappeared ?!

99
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,900
What ?!

100
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,600
Pattern blue, Angel detected
directly beneath Unit 01 !

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
A...shadow...

102
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,600
What's this ?
Something's wrong !

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,100
Shinji, get out of there !
Shinji...

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Ikari...

105
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
Idiot, what're you doin' ?!

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,800
Misato, what's going on ?!

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Misato...?  Asuka, Ayanami,
what happened to my backups ?!

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
Misato, can you hear me ?!

109
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
Eject the plug !
Send the signal !

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
No use !
It doesn't respond !

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,500
Misato...Misato...!

112
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
Shinji !

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Asuka, Rei,
save Unit 01, hurry !

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,100
That idiot, what's the point of scoring the highest on a sham exam ?

115
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,800
It disappeared again.

116
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,100
Asuka, be careful.

117
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,800
Shadow...?!

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,600
No !

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The city...

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Asuka, Rei, withdraw.

121
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Wai...

122
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait, Unit 01 and
Ikari are still...

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
That's an order.
Withdraw.

124
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,400
Major Katsuragi is in
a difficult position.

125
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,700
When the umbilical cable was pulled up,
it was disconnected.

126
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,100
That means...

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,900
Internal power's limited...

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,800
...but if Shinji doesn't move Eva randomly and stays in life support mode...

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,500
...he can stay alive
for about sixteen hours.

130
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,900
Second tank squadron,
deployment complete.

131
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,800
Roger, wait for orders
at your current position.

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,100
Sub Laser, channel's open.
Send data.

133
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Copy.
Transmitting on channel C.

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,400
UN Force's siege complete.

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
What about the shadow ?

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,200
It hasn't moved. It's been staying still ever since it reached a diameter of 600 meters.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,300
I wonder if the ground
forces will do any good.

138
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,200
They want to pressure us.

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh my, oh my, acting by himself,
ignoring the plan...

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,900
Yeah, this is all his fault.

141
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,900
Just because he scored
highest on yesterday's test...

142
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,500
...how could he say,
``I'll show you how it's done ?''

143
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,600
He was so elated.

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,100
W...what ?

145
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,400
You don't want to hear
bad things about Shinji, huh ?!

146
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you pilot Eva just to
have people praise you ?

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, not by other people !
I want to praise myself !

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
Stop it,
both of you !

149
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,100
That's right.
It was a selfish act, so...

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
...I'll have to scold
him when he gets back.

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
NEON GENESIS

152
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I never thought that going to sleep could be so tiresome.

153
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,800
It's completely blank.
No response on radar or sonar.

154
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,900
This space is too broad.

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,400
It's been twelve hours since
I switched to life support mode.

156
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,000
My life will last only
five or six hours...

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm hungry.

158
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,500
So, that shadow's the
main part of the Angel ?

159
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Yes, about 680 meters in diameter
and 3 nanometers thick.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
It sustains that super-thin
space with an inverted AT-Field...

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,500
...and the inside is an imaginary space called ``Dirac's Ocean.''

162
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,100
It might be connected
to another space.

163
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,800
What's that sphere then ?

164
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,900
That should disappear when
the main body's destroyed.

165
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,000
That floating object
is nothing but a shadow.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,100
The black shadow that drew
Unit 01 inside is our target...?

167
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
How can we
handle that thing ?

168
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,600
It's getting muddy.
The purifying function is weakening.

169
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
It smells fishy...blood...?
It's the smell of blood.

170
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,900
No, I can't stand this !
Why can't I unlock this ?!

171
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,900
Open up !
Let me outta here !

172
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,600
Misato, what's happening ?!

173
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
Misato, Asuka, Ayanami !

174
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,900
Ritsuko...Father...

175
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Please, someone help me.

176
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Compulsory salvage of Eva...?

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,300
That's the only method we
could come up with for now.

178
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Dropping all existing
992 N-2 bombs into its center.

179
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,900
Taking timing into account and letting the two AT-field protected Evas...

180
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,500
...infiltrate the imaginary
area for only 1 millisecond.

181
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,900
Focus the explosive power
right before that moment...

182
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,500
...and destroy both the
Angel and the Dirac's Ocean.

183
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,400
But Eva's body won't...
We don't know what'll happen to Shinji !

184
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,100
We can't call it
a rescue operation !

185
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Recovering the body of Unit 01 is the top priority in this operation.

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Even if it's severely damaged,
it'll still be fine.

187
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
Wait a minute !

188
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,800
In this situation, the pilot's condition can't be taken into account.

189
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,400
Losing Shinji is your fault.
Don't forget that.

190
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,200
Why are you and Commander Ikari
so concerned about Unit 01 ?

191
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
What is Eva ?!

192
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,800
The information I gave
to you is everything.

193
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,200
You're lying !

194
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,900
Misato, trust me.

195
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,400
I'll command everything
in this operation.

196
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll stage the
flights from Kanku.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,100
Contact the JASDF's
control and mobility squadron.

198
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,900
The Second Impact...
Human Complement Project...Adam...

199
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,100
There're so many secrets
that I don't know.

200
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Who are you ?

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Who are you ?

202
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,500
Ikari Shinji.

203
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,300
That's me.

204
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm you. Everyone has
another self within them.

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Two figures make
one individual.

206
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Two ?

207
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,100
The one seen by others and
the one who's looking at them.

208
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,200
There are many
Ikari Shinjis.

209
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,400
The one in your mind,
the one in Katsuragi Misato's mind...

210
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,700
...the one in Souryu Asuka's mind,
the one in Ayanami Rei's mind...

211
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,600
...and the one in
Ikari Gendou's mind.

212
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Each of them are different,
but they're all Ikari Shinji.

213
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,800
You're concerned about
Ikari Shinji in other's minds.

214
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,100
I don't want
others to hate me.

215
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,100
You don't want
to get hurt.

216
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,200
Whose fault ?
My father's fault.

217
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
It was my father
who abandoned me.

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
It's my fault.

219
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,200
You tend to think you're wrong,
that's so called self-destructive.

220
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm useless.

221
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
You think you're
useless, right ?

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't you trust
your father ?

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think I hate him,
but I'm not sure now.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Well done, Shinji.

225
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Father called my name.
Father praised me.

226
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,600
So, you want to live
with that happiness.

227
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,900
If I trust his words,
I can live.

228
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,700
By deceiving yourself...?

229
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,100
Everyone's the same.
Everyone lives by doing that.

230
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,400
If you don't believe you're doing alright, you can't live.

231
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,800
There're too many hardships
for me to live in my world.

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
For example,
you can't swim ?

233
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,200
Humans aren't
born to float.

234
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
It's self deception.

235
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,200
Whatever you want
to call it !

236
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,200
You've closed your eyes and shut your ears to unpleasant matters.

237
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,300
In that incident,
his sister was...

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,700
It doesn't matter
what others think !

239
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Go home !

240
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
No, I don't
want to hear it !

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
See, you're running
away again.

242
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,000
You can't live by spinning
only a thread of happiness.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Particularly, I can't.

244
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
I found something interesting.

245
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,300
To find something interesting
and stick to it...

246
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,200
...what's wrong with that ?!

247
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,000
The entry plug's backup power has
reached its theoretical limit.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,100
The plug suit's life support system has almost reached the danger zone.

249
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Let's move up our
schedule twelve minutes.

250
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,200
While there's a possibility
that Shinji's still alive...

251
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,800
Father, am I an
unwanted child ?

252
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,000
Father !

253
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,800
You ran away yourself.

254
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,800
That's right, he might be
the one who killed his wife !

255
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,500
He killed his wife !

256
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,700
No !
My mother was smiling.

257
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,400
You did something
you can be proud of.

258
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
Shinji, don't run away.

259
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,000
Good luck.

260
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,800
I don't want to be...

261
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,500
...alone...

262
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,800
I don't want...

263
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,100
The temperature control and
air circulation have stopped.

264
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,400
It's cold.

265
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
No, the suit's
reaching its limit.

266
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,300
Is it over ?

267
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm tired of...

268
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,900
...everything.

269
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
Mother...?!

270
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,500
Are you satisfied ?

271
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,000
I see, that's good.

272
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
The two Eva units
are in position.

273
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
Get ready to generate
the AT-field.

274
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,300
Roger.

275
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,500
Sixty seconds to bomb drop.

276
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,700
What's happening ?!

277
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,800
Status ?

278
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,700
Not sure !

279
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,400
All gauges are
off the scale !

280
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
We haven't done anything !

281
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,500
Could that be Shinji ?

282
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,600
Impossible !
Unit 01's power is zero !

283
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,600
Am I piloting
something like ``that''...?!

284
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,700
What...what did
we copy it from ?

285
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,200
I know it's not just
a copy of the first Angel...

286
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,400
...but what will NERV do with Eva when it defeats all the Angels ?

287
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,300
Shinji...Shinji...Shinji...

288
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Shinji...
Are you alright, Shinji ?

289
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,700
I just wanted
to see...again.

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,100
Aren't you supposed
to scold him ?

291
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,600
I never thought that the Eva
was so frightening, until today.

292
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,500
I wonder if Eva's
really on our side.

293
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,300
It might hate us.

294
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,600
Major Katsuragi might have
become aware of something.

295
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,200
I see.
It's alright for now.

296
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
If Rei and Shinji become aware of
Eva's secret, they won't forgive us.

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,800
Stay in bed today.
We'll take care of the rest.

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm alright.

299
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,000
Really ?
That's good.

300
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
I can't get rid of
the smell of blood.

Eva Unit 04 under development
in Nevada, explodes...

...during its activation experiment
