00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,900
NEON GENESIS

5
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:07,700
Like a cruel angel...

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,800
...young boy, become a legend.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,200
Even though the blue wind knocked at the door of your heart...

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:38,300
...you kept looking and smiling only at me.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,000
Lost while searching for something soft...

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,400
...your honest eyes show that you haven't realized your fate.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
But someday, you'll recognize that on your back...

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,900
...you have the wings to fly to the distant future.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,100
A cruel revelation from the angels will fly out from a window soon.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:22,600
When you deny your memory with your spurting and burning pathos...

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Shine and hold up the sky.
Young boy, become a legend.

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,000
Did you see her  ?

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,500
Yes ! Yes !

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,600
What ?

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Don't you know
that foreigner ?

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Foreigner ?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah, that transferee to
2nd year, Class A, last week.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,500
She's really good.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
I heard her name's
Souryu Asuka Langley.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
She's truly cute.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,100
She has returned from abroad.
I wonder if she's more mature.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,800
Don't be silly.

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
I guess she had a difficult separation in Germany.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,000
And she can't recover from her wounded heart in an unfamiliar country.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Everyone keeps saying,
``Asuka,'' ``Asuka.''

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,500
Everyone looks relaxed.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,400
Thanks again.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,400
The pictures don't show
her true personality.

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Hello, Shinji.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,400
Guten Morgen.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
Guu...guuten morugen.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,600
You even look gloomy
in the morning.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,400
It is ``I'' who's talking to you.
Why don't you look more pleased ?

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,400
And the other
one's here too, right ?

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,500
Who ?

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,900
Are you stupid ?

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
Who else, but
the First Child ?

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Oh, Ayanami...

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,200
Hello !

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,200
You're Ayanami Rei,
the pilot of the prototype.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm Asuka. Souryu Asuka Langley,
the pilot of Eva Unit 02.

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,500
Be my good friend.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,600
Why ?

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,500
Because it's convenient
in many ways.

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
If I'm ordered to,
I will.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
You're strange.

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,000
That's true. I guess only the eccentric ones're selected as Eva pilots.

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,500
You lost weight,
didn't you ?

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,600
Have I ?

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
You're in a sad love.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,800
How do you know that ?

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Because those who have a mole in the path of tears are destined to weep all the time.

57
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,700
Are you going to seduce me ?

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,300
But it won't work, because
a SCARY lady's watching us.

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,400
Long time no see, Kaji.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
Well, it's been a while.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
You're a little more
careless than I remember.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,300
He was stupid,
and he still is.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,200
Since Unit 02's transfer is finished,
why don't you go home ?

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,900
I was officially notified of my transfer this morning. So, I'll be staying here.

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,300
We can hang out together,
like we used to do.

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,200
Who'd want to...?

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Enemy attack ?

68
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,700
Report from the
on station cruiser, ``Haruna.''

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,400
``We detected a gigantic object near Kii peninsula. We're sending data.''

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
Received data analyzed.

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,700
Wavelength pattern, blue,
it's a confirmed Angel.

72
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,500
All personnel,
first class battle stations.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Episode #9

Momentarily
Unite the Minds.

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,600
Tokyo-3's intercept system was heavily damaged in the previous battle.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Currently, only 26%
has been repaired.

76
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,600
Our operational equipment for this battle is almost zero.

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,900
So, we'll defeat the target before it reaches land.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,300
Unit 01 and Unit 02 will
continuously attack in turns.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,800
It'll be a
close range battle.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,700
Roger.

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,900
This's my combat debut in Japan,
why aren't I allowed to fight alone ?

82
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,800
It can't be helped.
That's the plan.

83
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,700
Let me remind you. Don't do anything that disturbs me.

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Why was a boy like him
selected as a pilot ?

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,100
It's unfair to attack together.
I don't like it.

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,300
We don't have any other choice,
if we want to survive.

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,100
It's coming !

88
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,200
Commence the attack.

89
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,100
OK, I'll go first.
Cover me.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Cover you...?


91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,500
Ladies first !

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,900
Damn, newcomers
shouldn't take control.

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
I can do it !

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Good job.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
How about that, Third Child ?

96
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Battle must always be
elegant and without waste.

97
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,600
That's cheating !

98
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,400
At 10:58:15 a.m. today...

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
...Unit 01, attacked by Target ``A,''
which separated from the original...

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,100
...and was sunk two kilometers
from Suruga Bay.

101
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,600
Twenty seconds later, Unit 02, attacked by Target B, was also immobilized.

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,700
Here's a comment from the person in charge of Operation E.

103
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,000
``They look bad.''

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Geez. My combat debut was
messed up because of you !

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,300
What are you talking about ?!
It's because you did something moronic !

106
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Moronic ?!

107
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,900
How can a slow boy like
YOU say that ?!~~Of all the nerve !

108
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,600
Say what ?! Because you were in such a hurry to win, it turned into a big mess !

109
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,100
Look at that !~~It's like a corpse in the sea !~~It's so uncool !


110
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
How can YOU say that ?!


111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,100
Nerv aborted the operation at 11:03 a.m...

112
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,800
...and gave command to
the U.N.'s Second Force.

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
It's so humiliating.

114
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,500
At 11:05, they attacked the target with an N-2 bomb.

115
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,700
We have to
redraw the map again.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,900
They succeeded in incinerating
28% of its components.

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
They got it ?

118
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,000
That only retarded its motion.
The next attack is only a matter of time.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,900
Well, it's fortunate that we gained some time to prepare another plan.

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,600
Listen, you two, do you
understand what your job is ?

121
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
To pilot Eva.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,900
No !
To defeat the Angels.

123
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Nerv doesn't exist to
commit such dishonorable actions.

124
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
Therefore, you must
cooperate with each other...

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
With someone
like him ?!

126
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
With someone
like her ?!

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh, forget it.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
Why do people
get angry so easily ?

129
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,300
Adults don't like
being humiliated.

130
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
Excuse me,
where's Misato ?

131
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,800
Cleaning up
the aftermath.

132
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,300
There's someone in charge who
exists to take responsibility.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,100
These are complaints and the damage reports from the ministries involved.

134
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,700
And, here's an
invoice from the U.N.

135
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,800
There are complaints from
the publicity section.

136
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,500
You need to
look them over.

137
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
I already know
what they say.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,700
They say, ``If you're
going to fight, do it there.''

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,200
Good guess.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,900
Without being told, they'll fight once the Angels are defeated.

141
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
I'll defeat that Angel.

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,700
The Sub-commander is very angry.

143
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,000
If you humiliate him again,
you'll doubtlessly be transferred.

144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,300
It was good luck within bad luck
that Commander Ikari was absent.

145
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,700
And before you saw these,
you'd have been fired.

146
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,900
Then, you brought some good ideas so I won't be fired, right ?

147
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
Just one.

148
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Great, Dr. Akagi Ritsuko !
A kind old friend is all I need.

149
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,700
You're wrong. It's not me
who's saving an old friend.

150
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
Kaji came up
with this one.

151
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Kaji did ?

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm back....

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
...but no one's here...

154
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,100
What the hell're these ?

155
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,500
How rude.
That's my stuff.

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,200
W...why're you here, Souryu ?

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Why're YOU still here ?

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Still here ?

159
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,000
You're unnecessary.

160
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,100
Misato is going
to live with me.

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,400
Well, that'd be the right choice,
considering who's better.

162
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
To tell the truth,
I wanna live with Kaji.

163
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,900
Anyway, why're Japanese
rooms so small ?

164
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Half of it wouldn't
even fit in here.

165
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,200
And, why do Japanese
people lack precautions ?

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
How can you live in
a room without a lock ?

167
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Unbelievable.

168
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,000
Because the Japanese believe in understanding and kindness.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Misato.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Misato.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Welcome home.
You two seem to be doing well.

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,500
Doing what ?

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,500
Doing what ?

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,600
Preparation for
the next operation.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,700
What do
you mean ?

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,700
What do
you mean ?

177
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,900
The seventh Angel has
only one weak point.

178
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,600
A simultaneous concentrated attack on both cores is the only way.

179
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,600
In other words, that's an attack by two completely synchronized Evas.

180
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,200
In order to do so, you have to cooperate for a perfect unison.

181
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,300
So, you're going to
live together from now on.

182
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,400
What ?!

183
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,400
What ?!

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,400
No, I won't !~~They say men and women should live separately after age 7 !

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,700
The Angel
is regenerating.

186
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,000
The second attack is predicted in 6 days.
We don't have time.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
That's impossible.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, to make
the impossible possible...

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,600
...you have to memorize the attack pattern, harmonized with this music...

190
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,100
...as soon as possible,
within six days.

191
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
NEON GENESIS

192
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,900
I wonder what
happened to Shinji.

193
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,200
He's been absent from school for the last three days.

194
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,400
Oh, Class Rep.

195
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Two of the idiot trio.

196
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,200
How come you're here ?

197
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
I've come to see Souryu.
Why are you here ?

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
To see Ikari.

199
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,700
Why'd you
stop here ?

200
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Coming !

201
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Coming !

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
You've betrayed us.

203
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,500
You're in that
pair-look again. That's sick.

204
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,200
This is because Misato said, ''Japanese should begin things with appearance.''

205
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,400
You two are so indecent !

206
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,700
It's a misunderstanding !

207
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,700
It's a misunderstanding !

208
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,600
It's nothing like a
misunderstanding or overstatement....

209
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh, welcome.

210
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,700
Please tell us what
this is all about.

211
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,500
You should have
told us first.

212
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,400
So, is their
unison going well ?

213
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
See for yourself...

214
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,300
It's so obvious ! I can't adjust
``down'' to Shinji's level !

215
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,200
It was impossible
in the first place !

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Then, you're giving up ?

217
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
There's no
one else, right ?

218
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,200
Rei.

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,100
Yes.


220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,100
Give it a try.

221
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,700
Okay.

222
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe it would be better to change the plan,
and have Shinji team up with Rei.

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,300
No, I can't stand
this any more !

224
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,200
A...Asuka !

225
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,100
That's called,
``Tears in the devil's eyes.''

226
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Ikari !

227
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Follow her !

228
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,800
You made her cry !
You should take responsibility !

229
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Um...


230
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,700
Don't say anything.

231
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,500
I know.
I must pilot Eva.

232
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
I'll do it.

233
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,700
We must triumph
over Rei and Misato.

234
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
Wha...triumph over...?

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
How could you be so naive ?
You are a man, aren't you ?!

236
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I must have revenge
for my hurt pride !

237
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,500
Where's Misato ?

238
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,100
Working. It's gonna be an all nighter.
She said so on the phone.

239
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,100
Then, we're
alone tonight.

240
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,000
This's the indestructible
wall of Jericho.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
If you cross this wall,
you'll be executed !

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,100
Children shouldn't
stay up late.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How can the Japanese
sleep on the floor ?

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Unbelievable.

245
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200
Mama...

246
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
Mama...

247
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
You're a child, too.

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
No, someone'll see us.

249
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,400
Who will ?


250
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Who ?

251
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,600
Geez. You're no longer my boyfriend.
Don't do this again.

252
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,900
But, your lips
didn't say, ``stop.''

253
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Your lips or your words...
which should I trust ?

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Here.

255
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Thank you.

256
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
It's rare to see you sober.

257
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,100
For some reason...


258
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Work, or a man ?

259
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
Many things.

260
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,600
Still in love...?

261
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't be ridiculous !~~Who could
love that kind of guy ?!

262
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,900
Even though I was young, it was my biggest disgrace that I hung around with him.

263
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,600
Well, I was
talking about Kaji.

264
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,700
Did I upset you ?

265
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,000
You are...

266
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
Your anger proves
that I hit the mark.

267
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,900
You should be more frank.
Things are different from 8 years ago.

268
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,500
Nothing's changed.
He's still immature.

269
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh well, I've got work to do.
The final battle is tomorrow.

270
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,700
Target's passed our final defense line at Goura.

271
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Here it comes.
We won't fail this time.

272
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,100
When the music starts,
expand an AT-field.

273
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,900
Then, proceed as planned.
Okay you two ?

274
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,700
Got it.

275
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,700
Got it.

276
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,600
Target's entered
the mountain region.

277
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,300
Listen, we'll begin the full performance at full speed, okay ?

278
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,200
I know. We'll finish
it in 62 seconds.

279
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,900
Target's arriving
at point zero.

280
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,600
Purge the external
power supply.

281
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Launch.

282
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,700
Both Evas confirmed.

283
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,000
Ouch.

284
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,700
Looks bad.

285
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey, look what you've
done to MY Unit 02 ?!

286
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,900
It's not my fault !
You hit me first !

287
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,800
It was ``you'' who
missed the timing first !

288
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
It's because
you're always slow !

289
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,100
Besides, why were you awake so late last night ?

290
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,900
I was doing image training
for today's battle.

291
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Liar ! You tried to kiss me while I was sleeping, didn't you ?

292
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not fair to
pretend to be sleeping !

293
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
That's terrible !


294
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,900
I was only joking !
So, you really did it !~~You kissed me !

295
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,200
No, I didn't !
I stopped !

296
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,300
Lech, molester, pervert !
I can't believe this !

297
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,600
It was your fault for
sleeping in the wrong bed !

298
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,600
They're humiliating us again.
